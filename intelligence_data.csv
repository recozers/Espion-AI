INTElliGENCE SOVIET AND N Q Date The present estimate is an editorial adaptation of with certain and to bring it up to The intelligence of the Depart of the the and the Force in the preparation of this estimate and concur in This paper is based on information available on Authority R E SOVIET AND To estimate Soviet and intent with particular reference to the date at which the might be prepared to engage in a general THE PROBLEM The Soviet are simultaneously moth by doctrine and by related to the position of the Soviet Union as a world Their ultimate is to establish a Comma list world by themselves or their their immediate con an consistent with that To maintain the control of the Kremlin over the of the Soviet To strengthen the economic and mile try position and defend the territory of the Soviet To consolidate control over the mean and Comma list To make secure the strategic to the Soviet and to prevent the stab in and of ca table of threatening the Soviet To eliminate Up influence in and To establish Soviet domination over and To weaken and the non Soviet world especially to under mine the power and influence of the The Soviet Union will try to pursue these immediate In case of conflict between one and another of these it may be that the Soviet will attach greater import dance to the first four and in that Inasmuch as the Soviet ultimate objective is immutable and the Soviet Union will continue relentlessly its aggressive sure on the particularly on the power position of the Western Consequently there and will continue to grave danger of war between the and its on the one and the Up and its allies on the The Soviet could achieve and are the first three of their immediate and without risk of in movement in armed conflict with the United immediate Their and are improbable of achievement without resort to armed although there are still in the which might well lead the Soviet to suppose in favorable might eventually achieve these object times without the use of Soviet In pressing to achieve these latter object times the Soviet will inevitably impinge upon vital of the Western and thus incur the risk of involvement in a general war through Western In the belief that their object cannot be fully without a general war with the Western the Soviet may de deliberately provoke such a war at the time in their the relative strength of the is at its It is that such a period will exist from now through with the peak of Soviet Is assumed to be the date by which North Atlantic Treaty in will have been built up to such strength that they could withstand the initial shock of Soviet attack and by which the gap between the military strength of the Western and that of the will have begun to Authority strength relative to the Western be ing about From the point of view of military and economic the Soviet Union is in a position to conduct a general war now at least to conduct the listed in if the Soviet should consider it desirable or expedient to do Intelligence is to permit a valid prediction as to whether or when the would actually resort deliberately to a general It must be that a grave danger of general war and will exist hereafter whenever the Soviet may elect to take action which the vital of the Western Specifically with respect to the to date there is insufficient evidence to indicate that the to commit Soviet overtly in the After the made good certain in atomic bomb stockpile and certain aircraft and before the Western economy been fully geared for a war commitment of Communist with Soviet material that the the of suffix client importance to warrant the risk of real The probability is that the Soviet Union that the Up will not launch a general war over Communist inter mention in North and the reaction The principal risk of general war is through the exercise of Soviet initiative which the Kremlin to The probe ability is that the Soviet Government not yet made a decision directly to launch a gen real war over the There a good chance that they will not in the immediate future take such a At what point they will take a decision to launch a general war is not now determine able by The foregoing represent the best that can be on the basis of the information available at this The problem of whether and when the may resort deliberately to general war is under consideration and be the subject of future re as pertinent information is Authority T It T DISCUSSION SOVIET The Soviet are simultaneously moth by doctrine and by related to the position of the Soviet Union as a world Their ultimate objective is to establish a Comma list world by themselves or their their immediate con all consistent with that To maintain the control of the Kremlin over the of the Soviet To strengthen the economic and mile try position and defend the territory of the Soviet To consolidate control over the mean and Comma list To make secure the strategic to the Soviet and to prevent the stab in and of ca table of threatening the Soviet To eliminate Up influence in and To establish Soviet domination over and To weaken and the non Soviet world especially to under mine the power and influence of the The Soviet Union will try to pursue these immediate In case of conflict between one and another of these it may be that the Soviet will attach greater import dance to the first four and in that AFFECTING SOVIET AND There is nothing in Soviet or in the internal situation of the Soviet which or either deliberate resort to war or the achievement of any particular objective by any given The Soviet appear to believe provided the security of the Soviet Union can be time will be on their side in the achievement of their objective of world communication under Kremlin domino The Soviet have that they are more immediately concerned with the power position of the Soviet Union than with their In add they have made it clear that they will not rely solely on the operation of historical but will actively and aggressively press for the realization of their see also Appendix A for a discussion of political and morale the event of Appendix B for a discussion of Soviet and particular armed if even though serious may be A Soviet decision to risk general war by the use of armed force in any particular even a deliberate resort to general would depend The Soviet estimate of the importance of the particular situation in to their The of the involved by other Their estimate of their of proving their power position in a general The Soviet Union already largely mo billed its industry for It now through and of war materiel and a great person dance of military which it to maintain superior military not only consideration of Soviet nuclear energy production Authority strength in being but also to have at its dis postal a readily reliable additional The on the other except for a few specialized is only beginning to mobilize its industry for The economic war potential of the Western is and for an number of will continue to superior to that of the Soviet Union and its the Western can not immediately assert their greatly superior economic war since it will require to mobilize their Under these the present move among the North Atlantic Treaty count for gearing part of their to production of is a most important because from the great preponderance of Soviet military derived its large of war will begin to and after may have to be a significant There other which might well induce the Soviet to interpret their own economic preparedness for war in a different In undertaking a war against the Western at an early date the Soviet could look forward to sweeping initial They take into account that such a war would probably be and become one of and that the industrial and economic structure the Soviet Union would be exposed to severe although some of these could be at least partially offset by Soviet control over of Western and other as a result of Soviet in the early stage of the There that in the next and succeeding coal attention will be given to the strategic of the in into better balance with the basic in improving the transportation and better in the dispersal of The Soviet may hesitate to risk a global war if they consider that the future economic military strength of the West the immediate military advantage they hold over the Western How the date at which the Soviet might be prepared to take the of a major war against the Western is unknown since there is no intelligence available con meaning what evaluation the Soviet are making of this Consideration of the known that point of view of output and stockpile of war mate the period when the Soviet Union could assert its military strength most advantage only against the Western is between now and the end of of Mass Destruction and Scientific The atomic bomb is the only weapon of mass destruction which would be a major factor in a Soviet decision to assume the risk of a major The current estimate regarding the Soviet atomic bomb stockpile is as The Soviet Union and will have sup ancient trained and bases of operation to warrant an attempt deliver in the United and in the United Kingdom the full stockpile of atomic that are now and will become Should local con require the dropping of by other than visual the efficiency of Soviet bomb placement may be adversely In the Soviet Union the Capable for clandestine atomic in and in selected inland and may be able to launch with atomic war from within the period un view of present and future Soviet atomic it is apparent that the total power of the Soviet Union been and is being in The United now a wide mar gin of of in over the Soviet it would be illuSory to conclude that the United and Western will remain safe from atomic attack so long as the United Authority e E this numerical When the Soviet believe that they have produced a sufficient quantity of atomic to be seriously crippling or decisive against the Western the danger of So attack will be greatly When the have this atomic capable the Up superiority in total of atomic will no longer be a deterrent the Soviet decision for in the same real time degree as The extent of Soviet vulnerability to a retaliatory Up attack affect Soviet It is impossible to state when the may estimate they have this capable This may occur at any time and the sit nation may become critical at any time within the next two As other of scientific de it is considered that the Soviet would probably be willing to assume the risk of a major war at any time after the end of Ground The military effectiveness of the Soviet Union is being steadily At present the Soviet Army about line div and could rapidly mobilize about and subsequently increase this number if By about rear and equipment will have been By that date the Soviet should be able to place reliance on the to the extent that an increase ing proportion can be to fight well against hereditary The Soviet Union the advantage of a concentration of force on interior and potentially of ever the The state of readiness in the North Atlas tic Treaty Organization is far below that of the Soviet Reaction to the many of these to plan in national armed Even by North Atlantic Treaty Organization achieve parity with the Soviet Union in of men un arms or in of certain of Under the impetus of aid from the United coupled with an increase in at the which should be available to North Atlantic Treaty Organization for the mid to are to be and At present the Soviet Union the capability of in Western without any additional warning and Western with an initial force of about at present in East and and of rapidly building this force to about to In such event the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are not at present capable of prevent ing the of Western ex the United It is that it will be found progressively to build up the North At Treaty Organization in so by they will be capable of standing the initial shock of such a surprise In the Near and Middle East the in the of Tur and are largely a matter of modernization rather than There little military advantage from the viewpoint of the Soviet Union in opening in this area in any particular year between now and From purely an army if the So are willing to to or to accept the risk of a general it would be in to do so at some time between now and with the optimum date being about the middle of the Air The authorized military aircraft strength in of the Soviet Air is to be aircraft at the While definite information is lack it is that the actual aircraft strength of the operational may be ten to fifteen percent below the authorized In addition to the aircraft in national it is that there are some combat aircraft in Besides the the combat Authority would be the Civil Air Fleet with an strength of major an unknown number of concealed far example those of the plus combat aircraft in the training command support and those assigned for and No significant change is in the organization of the Soviet Air over the next few nor is there evidence to suggest that the front line strength will change materially over the same it is that the proportion of high will increase con miserably and advance in bomber interception and strategic can be The Soviet Military Air Force is call superior to Western tactical air and is adequate to support all land which the Soviet might be to undertake in event Of war in the next few Its combat is being steadily by of fighter and bomber with performance jet air The Soviet Naval Air Force is an effective coastal adjunct to Soviet Air Force and could be used in direct support of the Soviet It is that as in the case of the Military Air the combat value of the Naval Air Force wi increase as the re suit of in the next year or two and as the result further Soviet Union in quantity ex client day for fighter but at present is handicapped the bomber interception field by the lack of efficient all weather interceptor and effective ground con tool interceptor It is that a good interceptor will probably e in and that with ground control interception will have been largely outcome by the time this interceptor in In the Soviet Union should have a state of training and sufficient to pro video a relatively effective fighter defense The Soviet Union and will have the capability in aircraft and trained to able it to attempt to deliver in the United Kingdom and North the full stock pile of atomic that are and will become In the next few the strategic capability of the Soviet Air will increase particularly in view of the increasing atomic bomb The introduction of jet medium in and heavy in in the state force will increase the effective ness of this although the con necked with and navigate may not be fully by that Based on the above the So Union may assess its present air capable as adequate for the conduct of a major It is that Soviet air capable will be steadily and probably reach optimum relative to the Western in a state of readiness which the Soviet Union favorable for the conduct of major may be at any time from the present to Naval The surface naval of the Western are so much than those of the Soviet Union that the latter will not be able for many at least to dispute by surface the control of the major ocean comma The Soviet Submarine how is strong in comparison with the anti submarine of the Western and Soviet potential is high in compare with the avail able to the Western The Submarine Fleet is able now to exert a serious threat to Allied sea This threat will become progressively more serious with the increase in strength and improvement in performance of the Sub marine Fleet during the next few The Surface pose no serious threat to Allied of the but are probably ready now to accept the following Defense of sea of the Soviet Support of the award of the Soviet The Naval Air are capable now of supporting the surface in the above Authority The Soviet Merchant Fleet is capable of providing the lift for short range amphibious and of sustaining the wartime economy of the Soviet in the Far Civil The knowledge available that neither the Soviet nor block have yet taken effective of civil defense on a scale sufficient to cope with atomic PEN To THE SOVIET General The basic problem here considered is to estimate the of action that may be by the Soviet in pursuit of their as stated in paragraph It must be that a general war might occur as a result of some Soviet action without deliberate intention to precipitate a general war and even before the Soviet considered themselves fully ready for The Soviet while so far the direct use of their own military have shown themselves willing to employ every available short of Further session in the face of Western will carry with it an increasing danger of general Short of abandonment by the West of its policy of resisting Communist the only circumstance that could remove that danger would be the abandon by the Soviet Union of its policy of On the basis of Soviet conduct and declare of policy since there is no that the Soviet will modify their policy of In during the last year their have shown an apparently increasing disregard of possible Western read In the North at tack to mark a significant step ward in the even though the Soviet may have originally the risk of Up reaction to the North they have in their course despite Up The Soviet can be to con their aggressive on the power position of the Western In their choice of and method they will continue to follow a policy of They can be to continue to attempt to exploit every apparent soft such and tactics as seem best to particular The Soviet have shown while the rule of experience in choosing among the possible of they will not necessarily reject such as carry the risk of armed they would prefer not to take action of this nature so long as they that they were their immediate without they came to the conclusion that they were failing to obtain these by other they would be willing to assume the risk of their own dependent on their estimate of their of success both in their immediate and in coping with any resultant reaction by the Western the more closely they considered their related to the security of the Soviet Union the more readily they risk their own military In view of the an estimate of the danger and imminent of war can be based only on a review of the critical exist ing and together with a calculate of Soviet and in each the relative strength and state of prep ration of the and the impact of likely Western on Soviet In dealing with various critical and Soviet may at tempo to achieve their by Course short of deliberate re sort to general Course resort to general Authority Course One would in turn cover several possible of action which might be lower separately or These To use other than armed son across a To local military aggression by satellite armed To undertake local aggression by Soviet armed Course Two could follow either of two al alternative of action A direct attack on the United and its A deliberate provocation the virtual certainty of general and intended to precipitate Choice of Course One or Course One would seem to at least in large upon the urgency of Soviet preoccupation with the area in which such limited aggression were or Choice of Course on the other would amount to an attempt to destroy the power position of the Western either once and for or at least in and and would de end upon global From the political Course Two a is less likely than Course Two Course One Short of Deliberate Resort to General On the basis of the discussion in Appendix and apart from possible consider such as economic crisis in the West which the Soviet may think will work in their they probably estimate their somewhat as Course One a other than armed session across a Tibet and appear to be the only in which the odds presently favor the establishment of Communist In aid for indigenous must is essential and is being fur If were to come under Communist then and would probably quickly The state of public opinion in Western particularly in and in Western may give the Soviet reason to hope that their immediate aim of prevent ing the development of continental military strength can still be accomplished through agitation and internal the West do not reflect this state of popular and public opinion is and will continue to change as Western defense be come From now apart from the possible effect of the long term any which the Kremlin may now retain for success in West and Western will pro able The development of the situation in is less but here again it can be that as Western support the for the achievement of Soviet domination of without the use of external force will In the and the national are apparently capable of coping with any out of violence designed to lead to lin control of the On the other the Kremlin by propaganda and other hope to in some ma the political attitude of the and In the government is at of coping with of hence designed to lead to Soviet How the economic situation might deteriorate substantially in the next year at fu which case the authority of the government might be In and the current Communist guerrilla can probably be sustained and in the Soviet Union may attempt to large scale guerrilla at any the of these sup ported by the United or the United should be able to control the sit Course One b military aggression by satellite armed The Soviet Union already to indirect aggression by of Authority in B satellite in the case of Similar employment of could be at in the following although the Kremlin would have to recognize that rest aggression in any of them would in degree carry risk of general In Western and In Hong and Military success would be un likely in the of Turkey and and questionable in the case of In Western it would also be unlikely in the present state of development of the Police The incorporation of Berlin is an essential step towards the Soviet aim to secure a unified subservient to the An attack by the Police Beret at Soviet instigation upon the West em in Berlin might well pear to Soviet to have of local although the Soviet would have difficulty in responsibility for such an attack unless Soviet occupation had been previously withdrawn from the Berlin Tibet can be at any time without any risk of extension of Military success in is problematic but success could be assured against and Hong and Dom nation of and would out flank and control the major of rice to Static at present outside the Soviet could not then avoid ing under Communist and Ma lay would thus be directly Hong would be a lesser strategic prize and the difficulty of the war would be greater than in the case of and Course One c aggression by Soviet armed The Soviet may well consider that only against Finland and could Soviet be used directly without grave danger of immediately precipitation general and would recognize that even in those their use would bring general war precisely On The Soviet may have reason to mate that they can achieve some of their particularly in South and Southeast through short of armed agree son across a the apart from the possible effects of them little rea son to hope for through these of their major early those related to the armament of the West utilization of West German and military it can be assumed that they will continue to exploit every opportunity for the employ of such in order to regard Western defensive and to weaken and divide the A decision to employ indirect or direct mil aggression on a local scale will probably depend on early on the progress of Western defensive The Soviet might accept serious risk of general war in order to prevent the actual development of hostile military power on the strategic to the Soviet They would be particularly concerned at the recreation of West German or military It must be em that Soviet may well regard the progressive development of the situation in in the same light and may take local action Course Two Resort to General The Soviet under certain consider that it was to their advantage deliberately to engage in war with the Western it is I that they would be unlikely to take this step deliberately unless they were convinced that their important were plainly t be In they would have to of speedy naturalization of Up often of their ability to establish a degree of control over the land in the naturalization of the United Authority OR dom by occupation or that would give them the benefit of a considerable pro portion of industrial potential and would present the United with a mile try task of such that the United would be unwilling or unable to make the effort necessary to carry it A decision by the Soviet to resort to war under assumption above would presuppose their estimate that they had atomic or other to deal the United a blow sufficiently crippling to enable the Soviet Union to attain their war object A decision by the Soviet on the basis of assumption above would presuppose their estimate either with or without a limited attack on the United the Soviet by the acquire of Western industrial would be capable of supporting a and also their estimate that Soviet de could prevent crippling on the resultant Soviet economy SOVIET STRATEGIC AND In THE Of GLOBAL AR In the event of global war between the Soviet Union and the Western it is con ordered that Soviet action would follow genre ally along the set forth The Soviet plan would be to undertake the following Simultaneously A campaign against Western Eu rope An aerial bombardment against the against the Near and Middle East and in the Far against Canada and the United and the A sea and air offensive against sea Subversive and against in all of the Defense of the Soviet Union against hostile As soon as after the occupy of the Channel Port a sea and air offensive against the an As soon as against and the As air against It is that the Soviet Union would have sufficient armed to undertake all the listed above and still have suffix client armed to form an adequate re Opportunity by must which may or may not be di by the Soviet against neighbor ing in might be at any If war during the period under con little or no warning will be re and for considered the The Soviet armed are in an advanced enough state of preparation to achieve the outlined in this mate without any appreciable period of Authority APPENDIX A POLITICAL ALIGNMENT Soviet The following are likely to re mail in alignment with the Soviet In Eastern and probably is a possibility that may cease to be a Soviet satellite in the course of the next few provided remains outside the Soviet In Communist China and Outer In the event of a major war in the may be to be In the event of a war between the Soviet Union and the Western Communist China is not likely to deny to the Soviet Union any or and is likely to pur sue an opportunity policy of The Treaty of each party to render assistance to the other in the event of attack by Japan any other state which should unite with Japan directly or indirectly in of Communist China is unlikely to forfeit the of this all in present The political alignment of will de end on the outcome of the present United action In the event of any war between the Soviet Union on the one hand and the United King dom and the United on the it is considered that the following gather with their overseas will be in alignment against the Soviet Union from the outbreak of the United United Can New South and The following their over would probably also be against the Soviet but not unless the North At Treaty were the and Those not as would be at least benevolent and and may well decide to maintain status unless directly though their attitude would be sympathetic to the Western Treaty subject to the of the United also exist between the United Kingdom and and Under the Treaty of Mutual Assistance of in the United Kingdom and are obliged to go to the assistance of if Turkey is but Turkey is not obliged to assist her allies in a war against the Soviet Though the Turns are likely to fight rather than submit to any major Soviet de they would not otherwise necessarily join the Western The Treaty of in the Unit Kingdom to station limited land and air in the Canal On present the in the event of a war with the Soviet although probably favoring the Allied would not consent to the use of armed except possibly in of This would affect West use of bases in and Under the United Kingdom with Jordan and the agree to offer one another mutual In the case of assistance to the United Kingdom is limited to the provision of in Authority Apart from treaty all the will probably be disposed to favor the Western and to make avail able to them their economic and although they may be reluctant to assist in any active particularly if this the dispatch of outside their own present is to alignment with the United and to make bases available to the United The re will support the United in ing of effective under the Rio Active military assistance may be available in some It is even after the conclusion of a Peace at least base in that country will continue to be available to the Western Western and The position of the of Western Ger many and will depend on the develop of under the North Atlantic In the case of the element will be entirely sympathetic and may be to fall in with Western as far as it is able to do Neutral The following will in initially at to remain though some of them may in action by the United long as the and Most of these would probably resist if particularly if given So the present regime remains in power the Soviet Union will have to use force if it to make use of There is at present no indication of the existence of an alternative Communist of sufficient strength to carry out a but a severe deterioration in the economic situation within the next year or which remains a definite could materially affect the In the event of a major war in the Middle may be disposed to favor the Western as a result of cal or economic may assist MORE Soviet Soviet in responsible from the age of have been brought up on to the rigid exclusion of all The great will always be ready to support strong by Comma list in defense of Soviet national The Soviet people do not want but any war in which the Soviet Union involved would be to them as till to their national and few would be able to question the official version of The vast majority would acquiesce in the decision of the In the control over every form of human activity by the police and of the Soviet Union would be a source of unity and so long as the Soviet met with the of Soviet propaganda were by there is little doubt that evidence of Soviet inability to resist Allied strength would come as a shock to the people So long as police con tool this would not have any widespread Even if Allied counter the use of atomic police control being severely strained or the process of would probably be a slow The span people have in the past gently to expel foreign and even in the event of Allied air the majority of the population would fight on as best they Authority Although the Soviet have to reckon with a degree of disloyalty might be in among the in the Basic the the and Central rebellion on the part of these ethnic could not be unless Soviet police control had or Western support and protection were at The The majority of the in the satellite are intensely and large resent the domination of the Kremlin and the present Communist with which they are Although this attitude is a source of potential weakness to the Soviet there is no present evidence to indicate that it would give rise to further successful nationalist on nor would it produce effective resistance to the Soviet war effort unless the war were going badly for the Soviet Union and the disaffected were given guidance and support from the i In the event of major the nose Government could maintain festive control over the general population in in and East and in most of the large through the political and police In South and Southwest where the must apparatus is yet fully and where some still remain in active the effective authority of the Government would pro able be limited to the principal and of and to the with and leaving millions of beyond its This would not endanger the regime un less an politically coherent oppose with outside were to develop within the There is no present indication of such a The Western The chief of weakness in Western morale are a general feeling of the inability to resist armed attack by the Soviet Union with an unwillingness to come involved in another and the lack of unity of purpose on the part of the Western These are enhanced by the intellectual and emotional of the vertical the social and trial unrest which Communism and by a general failure on the part of the rank and file of the Western to appreciate the real of life under a Communist In Western the internal Comma list threat is not serious except in and where the Communist have a con miserable hold on the labor in also among the The position of other Western will be materially affected by that of In although the majority of men are there is a wide spread feeling of There under present a considerable will illness to resist if war or to risk being in the of the under a Soviet occupation which is be coming accepted as If can be given real confidence in their with the support of their to withstand a Soviet this is likely to be not gone so far as to affect the attitude of the Government toward her The Soviet Union is aware of a general situation and in its propaganda to the West to devote more attention to the desire for peace and those of the Population most susceptible to peace than directly to expanding the Communist in these In Western there is general position to Communism and the Communist Party is unlikely to constitute a serious in eternal German morale is at present low and will deteriorate still fur unless Western can be given confidence that either they or the Western will be to defend Western from In the Middle although Communism is generally feared and the social structure is such that there is fertile ground Authority for The prefer to remain neutral in any conflict between the Soviet Union and the If they were directly at Western token resistance might be the strength and duration of which would depend on how the war went for the If it went the early emergence of a pro Soviet body of feeling might be The themselves are largely fervent though Communist have made little they are generally anti and no popular resistance to the Soviet Union can be In the non official intelligentsia there is considerable chiefly on account of the present policy of the Western toward In the event of a general conflict in which were involved in support of the there might be a risk that feeling would induce the to come out on the other Authority e R B B PEN To SOVIET NON In the following possible Soviet under Course One Short of Deliberate Resort to General are Northern and The immediate Soviet aim in Northern is to prevent the occupation and use of that area as a base of against the Soviet If the Soviet considered that a serious threat were they would accept a risk of global war if necessary to prevent such a The mate desideratum would be control of the entire thus not only its family and but also complete control of the Basic and free access to the North With the exception of Soviet sub version in Northern are extremely Even in Finland the element capable of keeping internal pressure under The only effective available for either of the above is the overwhelming local preponderance of Soviet military The coercive threat inherent in the pro city of overwhelming Soviet power in large to accomplish the immediate Soviet It on Finland a necessity to with the Soviet Union long as Soviet do not require national and is a main consideration causing to adhere to a fixed policy of Although and mark have to the North Atlantic they would be to permit in their which the Soviet Union could regard as an offensive the local employment of Soviet armed force for the subjugation of Northern is by regard for the Outright Soviet invasion of Finland would be by the the best of their This might well the immediate Soviet purpose in Northern by driving den into adherence to the North Atlantic Treaty and by in and An attack on would be and would also stimulate the in and and would involve risk of a general An attack on or would directly involve war with all the North Atlantic Treaty The Soviet will continue to maneuver toward the subversion of Finland by local by the imminent power of the Soviet but are unlikely to resort to local military action in Northern unless convinced that such action is necessary to prevent the occupation and the use of the area as a base for against the Soviet Union or that global war is Western Port Immediate Soviet in Western To prevent the of Western from becoming organized into a force capable of effective military position to the Soviet either as a work or destroy or impair Western confidence and association with the United and United To foster favorable the growth of communist Short of deliberate resort to general the only at the disposal of the Soviet Union for the pursuit of its Western i j F Authority consist of such as mass propaganda and parliamentary subversive infiltrate of armed and government industrial and and to stir up internal violence and civil common Since there been a generally trend in the effectiveness of such corresponding with a general in crease in the stability of the and in their ability to maintain internal due in large part to external economic despite the substantial of the Economic Recovery Western not yet economic via despite the made under the North Atlantic Treaty and the Mutual Defense Assistance the of Western have not yet been from paper into in certain is currently at a low the feeling of present circus to resist Soviet military attack being particularly marked The both to and latent is un likely to be without the stab ligament of real confidence that a Soviet in vision could be Under these it would be premature to conclude that the Soviet have given up hope of their in Western by their present As the actual implementation of Western defense in to obstruct it both psychology through further propaganda pressure upon and through and civil may be ex It that the of Western will be able to cope with such and to carry out their defense The objective of the Soviet Union in is clearly to secure a find completely subservient to the Pending achievement of this the Soviet Union will seek to main tain absolute control over its own zone of and to prevent the integration of Western into the North Atlantic It will especially seek to vent the establishment of a West German armed force that could bolster effectively the Western military The Soviet Union will continue to employ every indirect method available to undermine the Allied position in Western and to interfere with the stability efficient of the West German Govern To this Soviet will rely upon the West German Communist the entire East German state and Party certain extreme in Western and the potential of all Eastern for economic pressure on Western Their tactics will be in filtration of the West German Government and and probably in use of violence against both local and Allied They direct their attention toward comic building up popular pressure for Western troop and extending current opposition toward re encouraging development of quality and the al most universal desire for German To strengthen their propaganda the Soviet will make further paper cones to the East pro able a separate peace treaty and a token with draw of Soviet They will how diminish in any way their actual control the Eastern It is as unlikely that the Soviet will achieve their in Ger many through the above There are no that the West dislike of communism in general and Soviet domination in particular is in any way fishing or likely to Effective re armament of Western would the Soviet either to take a new preach in the struggle for Western or risk increasing Western utilization of West German military The importance that Soviet clearly attach to prevent ing the as well as certain in Soviet and in East that the Kremlin is considering the Authority R use of East German military to stab list control over Western While the Police is at present consider red inadequate to undertake a conquest as there is evidence that it being steadily In the near future the Kremlin may consider this force suffix gently strong to be used to attack the West and the possibility of such an at tack cannot therefore be The So would have to that this would

forestall any unfavorable shift in its power over a period of the came to the decision that it could not prevent the accomplishment of West German the establishment of a powerful Western coal and the close association of Western Ger many it would regard the ever genre of such a new power situation as a barrier to its and possibly as a threat to the of the Soviet The Kremlin would then either adjust itself to the restoration of a power in Western or resort to military action to prevent The first alternative would obliged the to forgo for an index terminate period its and to lose the remarkably favorable opportunity by the postwar power The second alternative would involve acceptance by the of the virtual certainty of global The Kremlin declared categorically that it could not reconcile itself to the rear of West Nevertheless it is impossible for us to determine at the present time which of the above the Kremlin would eventually In making its decision as between these the Kremlin will undoubtedly take into consider the relative global power position of the atomic as well as the armament of and Western We believe that if the Kremlin the scale and nature of the rear of Western in conjunction with the armament of the Western as likely to constitute nothing more than a barrier further expansion of the Soviet orbit in might logically adjust itself for the time being to such a while con winning to exploit its current in other We believe that on the other Western German and Western and political power to the Kremlin as likely to develop sufficient strength to constitute a threat to the security of the Soviet the Soviet Union would probably resort to military Authority at the time and place most van gaseous to If the Kremlin should decide to resort to

a new mean power situation from the close association of a with a powerful Western the would be faced with the of adjustment or resort to action to achieve in that the first alternative would require the to forgo its in for an indeterminate period and that the sec and alternative would involve the virtual certainty of global that the once it that such a situation was would be to decide that it more than a to which it could adjust itself only the time The already view the Allied occupation in Western the Western orientation of the and the existence of as to further ex mansion in but the

threat to security which could not be overcome by The and regeneration of Western which this prospect would would require an adjustment by the Kremlin not the time but for an thus losing for the

inconsistent with the presently uncompromising temper of the effectively by Soviet armed in an advanced state of readiness for maintenance and improvement of this state of readiness for war by the

while the Kremlin probably not definitely itself to any specific course of it is likely that the primary Soviet objective in a cease fire is to effect military in Although the may exploit the for a cease fire and the period of the armistice solely to improve their military position prior to the resumption of in we believe it more likely that the to an indefinitely Such an armistice in lead to a de division of at the Parallel and at the same serve to improve the of their in in Eastern by a propaganda and campaign where military action been unsuccessful so We believe that the Kremlin is fully aware that a risen engagement in would permit of Communist elsewhere in and would free Communist generally for utilization elsewhere in the The Kremlin may also estimate after a disengagement in the proximity of Communist in would require there mention of substantial Up ill and limit for armed against aggression j We believe that the Kremlin that a greatly risk of general war would result if it took the military necessary to overcome the Up in the Kremlin probably that the of in would put the in a better position to forestall the impending peace treaty and to pursue other important Far Eastern the Kremlin probably that the cessation of in even would facilitate the achievement of the complacency in the thus rear and bunting the impetus for German and rear The cannot be that the if they fail to achieve their in the Far East through political will resume the operation on a the greatly risk of an expanded conflict and even of general will use the cease fire and armistice as a cover for other local military or even a global Whatever may be the Soviet motive in suggesting a cease the will undoubtedly use any suspension or interruption of military action in to increase their offensive capability and to play upon the probable reluctance of the to resume to enhance their position at all of DISCUSSION THE COMMUNIST IRE PROPOSAL On Soviet Up Chief Delegate speaking on a Up program a vague suggestion that the should start for a fire and in On statement was to some extent by Soviet Acting Foreign Minister who stated to Up Ambassador Kirk that the native of fighting in of the Unified Command plus South Command and of the North Republic Command plus represent of the Volunteer should meet and con a military to include a cease Such an would be limited to strictly try and would involve political or territorial mat also that resumption of should be between the military represent the of the military initial reaction to the Malik speech was in an editorial in the Daily which endorsed proposal but to clarify attitude toward the cease This was on by a North broadcast in which the Communist propaganda line calling on the Army to drive the enemy into the sea was to driving enemy within the On the North and Communist accepted General offer to chang ing the site of to Kampong in the vicinity of the Parallel and setting the for from to As might have been panda in this period sought to show that the cease fire dis are a result of the of the Up and are being at the CURRENT STATION In NORTH KOR AND in have more than million in the face of a substantial increase in the effective ness of Up At the military situation in to be stalemate generally north of the Parallel after two unsuccessful Communist The can replace their heavy and can continue large scale military in if they receive assistance from the Soviet Union in equipment the commit substantial of heavily with strong air we believe that they will continue to be unsuccessful in their to defeat Up There are fairly reliable that some and heavy equipment are being and that some training in their use is going on in There is also a posse ability that the agreed to train and equip a substantial number of Communist It is even possible that the may soon have available sufficient in trained and with heavy to set the presently great advantage of Up in fire Communist air strength in the area been

air superiority in the were in fact able to offset Up air logistic would continue to hamper the movement of the material and necessary to permit Communist to sustain large scale in There is some evidence of limited Soviet participation in the beyond the known provision of antiaircraft equipment and technical Soviet may have flown jet aircraft in combat and fairly reliable state that Soviet are manning anti aircraft equipment in North There are also union formed of Soviet combat in many throughout near the bor There no firm of a Soviet intention to increase their participation in the

objective in a cease fire in or for the of action the are likely to pursue It is probable that the the to avoid moment to any particular course action until they have had an opportunity to study reaction of the West as the In spite of the cease fire the clearly are striving to improve their military They may to use the time by the cease fire proposal solely to improve their military position prior to a new to use the time by the army stick and to improve their m an essential disengagement of their and so to free them for deployment or as a cover for the possible of a global to use the armistice and post armistice as a first step toward the liquidation of the Communist military venture in If the pursue either of the first two their tactics will vary depending upon the length of time they may require improve their military If they pursue the third al they may attempt to the conflict by the division of at the Parallel or they may proceed from the armistice to a political settle of the conflict and even of Far Eastern PROPOSAL A IRE ARMISTICE SOLELY To IMPROVE Team MILITARY POSITION The Kremlin may have made its cease fire proposal with no intention of through the to concur son of a cease and for this course of The may have that the cease fire would result in a relaxation of Up which would permit to improve their military in The Kremlin may have that the mere announcement of a cease fire proposal would have an adverse effect on the morale of Up in the field and in The Kremlin may have reasoned that the mere announcement of a Soviet to bring about a cease fire would be a potent propaganda weapon in the Soviet The Kremlin may also have that the mere suggestion of a cease fire would bring to the fore divergent on the for a with divisive effects within and among the Up great divergence of is already evident between Republic of and its Up The cease fire proposal could serve as a cover for a Communist surprise attack or The Kremlin may intend to engineer a breakdown of armistice order to Soviet sup port to the and North and possibly the commit of Soviet in against this course of Although the Kremlin will press vigorously the propaganda van of its proposal and will be quick to exploit any division which might appear among the Up these would be merely the in fact broke off the at an early j if the took the native in breaking off the they would gain little in their to exploit the Soviet cease fire proposal to a subsequent increase in Soviet support of the and North CONCLUSION Of A AND ARMISTICE In To SECURE A LONG PROD In To IMPROVE Team MILITARY POSITION The Soviet cease fire proposal may have been intended to result in a cease fire and armistice and possibly in political which would afford the a longer time to improve the military position as a prelude to the resumption of for this course of A cease fire and armistice would provide a respite which would give the time and opportunity to improve their tic and tactical A cease fire and armistice would break the momentum of the Up military effort in If a cease fire and armistice were the propaganda and political in paragraph above would greatly against this course of If effective inspection were included in a cease fire and armistice the would have difficulty in building without sufficient military strength in North to change the military balance of power The Kremlin would have to recognize that if serious Communist of the cease fire and armistice were the Up might resume The abrupt resumption of by the after an armistice would in crease the of extending the CONCLUSION Of A AND A ARMISTICE In To UT THE CONFLICT The could follow either of two possible of action this The first would be to con an armistice and to prolong it The second would be to use the armistice as a first step toward a final settlement of the conflict or even of Far Eastern The might hope by of the first course of action not only to halt the but in to the division of on the thus a de for such a course of In the light of the heavy cost of the war thus the might well feel that de control over the area i north of the Parallel the most favorable on which the war could be brought to a It would enable the to avoid formal renunciation of any of their original of Up control over and a seat in the and the consequent loss of It might subject Up in the field to a and period of inaction and create official and popular on the part of the Up belligerent to withdraw their from in the face of a requirement to keep these in for an indefinite slow down the rate of mobilization and armament of the free It would give the time to in crease the combat effectiveness of in such elite as may be training with modern Soviet in It would provide the with an extended respite which they could use to further consolidate their control within It would give the Keeping regime time to strengthen its east coast against possible Nationalist per Keeping to build up strength in South China for possible action against Southeast or Hong and in East China for a possible invasion of It might relieve the of the requirement of sending substantial material aid to and also provide the with greater free dom of action to exert on vulnerable against this course of It would prevent the from their in It might also friction between the and North and bring to the fore of control over North and possibly which might eventually strain An indefinite postponement of maximum Communist in would in solve severe loss Communist It might encourage future Western resist to Communist The second possible course of action in pursuit of the objective of out the conflict would aim at the achievement of a final settlement of the conflict and possibly of Far Eastern It is probable that in a the would be at least able to outweigh the influence of the reduced and greatly Communist strong sup port from the or the which would presumably be by the of the final A final settlement in on Up would be a propaganda victory for the This would entail a loss in the prestige of both Communist China and the throughout the world and early in the Far for this course of A final settlement of the conflict would permit the to close out what they may consider a costly and warning It would permit the to proceed with the consolidation of their con tool in China and to and deploy their for possible military such as Southeast or It would result in the eventual withdrawal of Up from and would remove what the have declared a threat to the security of and the Soviet It would permit the to pursue by political and in what they to achieve by military The might estimate that final settlement of the war would slow the rate of Western armament and mobilization by removing the sense of urgency which the in nave against this course of The Up for a final settlement in will probably include for eventual unification of under a popularly The would probably regard such a solution as contrary to their in this

PROBLEM ESTIMATE Soviet We believe that the ultimate Soviet object time is a Communist world dominated by the and that the Kremlin its vital can be assured over the long run only by the elimination of all it can not This objective probably a Kremlin conviction that peaceful coexist once of and its empire on the one and the Up and its allies on the is impossible and that an armed conflict be teen them is eventually The principal immediate Soviet evidently To divide the To prevent West and To prevent implementation of the Up We believe the in the pursuit of its will during the period of this Seek to maintain an advanced state of and offset any increase in the of the Up and its Seek to force of the free world to adopt a policy of neutrality in the East West struggle and to deny their in strategic to the Up and its J Military Underlying Soviet Action We estimate that the armed of the have the capability of and the Near and Middle East and within a ly short The does not now have and would be unlikely to secure adequate naval or sufficient shipping to permit it to mount a successful invasion of the Western even it should seize the continent and the The Soviet Air Force is capable

the North Seek to prevent the development of any threat to the vital of the or to In impossible to estimate with any Seek to expand the territorial of conclusion with regard to the relative effectiveness Soviet and Up atomic warfare or with regard to the relative importance of atomic and convey in the issue of a future general We believe it Seek to undermine and secure control of not yet under Soviet the Soviet Authority that uncertainty concerning relative atomic warfare and concerning the effectiveness of atomic in deter mining the issue of a general war will be a though not necessarily a de torrent to the Kremlin in making a decision to initiate or deliberately provoke a general war with the Up during the period of this The is capable of sabotage against a variety of and of clandestine to attack the Up and its allies with and chemical We those would be on an apple cable scale only in conjunction with or lately preceding general military and that they would not be a decisive factor in any Soviet decision to initiate a general Possible Soviet of Action Without Intent to Precipitate or Incur Semi Risk of General War While in Soviet theory and practice war is an and on occasion in student for Communist object the Kremlin presumably if to attain its by short of resort to general i The Kremlin probably that exist for making limited progress toward both its immediate and at least during the period of this without provoking general because The deterrent effect of the Communist capability to overrun most of at The deterrent effect of Soviet capable for atomic The divergent of the Western and The general reluctance of the Western to become involved in general separation for of exposition is the inseparable connection of all posse of action must be kept in Political Warfare The Kremlin may consider the of success by political sufficiently fa notable to make other of action under For with the immediate active of dividing the Western under mining Up the program and prospective German and armament and with the ultimate objective of opposition to the Kremlin may fraudulent propose peaceful coexistence of the two and may encourage the West to hope for a settlement of outstanding by mutual In the vital area of the Kremlin will almost certainly con to press its to ex plot the fear of to intimidate by dis play of to raise of German unified and to use the Communist of and in an attempt to compound the political situation and obstruct effective Wherever elsewhere in the world are as in and the Kremlin will almost seek to strengthen the must position if favorable will support Communist Employment Communist The Kremlin during the period of this attempt to achieve some of its by the Comma to engage in additional military opera Such would involve risk of general war between the Up and the but the Kremlin might estimate that such opera could be so that general war would not be In of action short of it to amine each Society policy various of war limited Satellite or Soviet armed agree and even general Political as here all of political and economic action in the Up and propaganda and front Communist Party and trade union support of all of revolutionary and biological Authority and In the Kremlin may estimate that a must invasion of or would not involve a serious risk of war and that such an invasion would facilitate a must advance throughout Southeast and the consequent denial of the of that area to the free The almost certainly have the capability for conquering We consider an in vision of but we do not be live it probable during the period of this The are now capable of virtually all of north and we consider an invasion of possible at any The Kremlin probably that the alone do not have the for a successful invasion of so long as the Up policy of employ ing Up fleet for the defense of remains Under circus the Kremlin must that active Soviet participation in an attack on would substantially increase the risk of gen real war without necessarily the less of the We therefore believe it unlikely that the in circus would either encourage or participate in a Communist attack on Hong and Comma list seizure of Hong and Macro pro able would be militarily but would entry entail political and economic for the If present cond we it unlikely that forceful seizure of these will take place during the period of this Employment of Satellite The Kremlin during the period here attempt to achieve some of its through local military by the Satellite Kremlin probably because of the more direct impact such would involve greater risk of general war between the Up and the than similar local by must The Kremlin undoubtedly great importance to control is strategically of important and is gradually close with the con times to be a potential menace to Soviet domination over the and over the world Communist Satellite for an attack on are steadily It is possible that the Kremlin the issue as of such importance as to warrant acceptance of the involved in a Satellite in view of the increasing Western support of it is more probable that the lin that a Satellite attack would in solve not only serious risk of war between the Up or Up and the but also the dan ger that a conflict would develop into a general war between the Up and the On we believe a Satellite attack on during the period of this estimate is but not and Satellite for attack on and particularly on Turkey are too limited for conquest of those the Kremlin almost certainly that an operation against either of these would probably entail Up or Up intervention with the possibility of general war We that the is unlikely to launch a Satellite attack on either or Turkey during period of this West and Sat elite for military action against Allied in West or will probably remain so limited ing the period here considered and the risk of general war involved in such action would be so great that the is unlikely to launch a Satellite attack during this Employment of Soviet The Kremlin must realize that commit of major Soviet in any Satellite or Communist operation would greatly increase the risk of general war between the Up and the Wherever the would rely upon Satellite or Communist Authority for carrying out military against It doubt would provide such with technical and logistical aid and might participate in rear area if it considered the risk it might even provide Soviet in the forward Open So military would be unlikely excepting in considered of great importance to the and where Satellite are either unavailable or incapable of successful and The Kremlin pro able to secure control of and Tur key in order to eliminate bases that could be used for attack on the Soviet orbit and at the same time to secure bases from which the po of the free world in the Near East might be the available lite alone are probably not of conquering and certainly not capable of conquering such opera could be accomplished only with the time participation of Soviet The lin probably that the Up and Up almost certainly would come to the support of and Turkey and that in those circus a general war between the Up and the would probably An attack on or Turkey is therefore unlikely ing the period of this Of the where only Soviet are available for immediate employ is unstable and So control of would eliminate a potent till base for hostile action against the would deprive the West of a vast oil and would facilitate the subversion or con quest of the Near and Middle the Kremlin probably that the po political and economic instability and the wide spread feeling offer good of increasing Communist influence and even tally of Communist control without direct Soviet Under these we believe it unlikely that the Kremlin would it to incur the risk of war with the Western Pow ers involved in Soviet military But if the should use military force in their dispute with the Kremlin might then invoke the treaty and occupy at least northern that it could do so with relatively little risk of general war Employment of Soviet Against Up The Kremlin almost certainly that overt and commitment of So against Up in any area would involve not only a local war with the in which the Up might well use atomic but also the strong probability of general war with the a Up strategic atomic attack on the the Kremlin had decided to accept general war with the we believe a Soviet attack on West or Japan would be unlikely during the period of this If the conflict or is re need after a cease the Kremlin will pro able continue to aid the in ways which the Kremlin would not in solve serious danger of a break between the and the Comma list in were with de cuisine the Kremlin would probably in density its This aid might well include the introduction of It might even include the employment of Soviet to such an extent that a de local war between the and the would At every stage the Kremlin will pro able endeavor to keep open the possibility of ending the conflict by political neo if the global of the would be by disengagement in Possibility of General War Consideration of the degree of probability of Soviet military action in specific must be related to Soviet strategy and pol If the Kremlin should decide to tate or to accept general it might launch an attack in any area at any time any form as a prelude to such general Soviet are in an advanced state of ness and could initiate general war at any time with little or no The danger of general war now and will continue to Authority exist so long as the is in a position to take action which wholly or in the vital of the Western or that the Kremlin may at any time minister Western defensive as an imminent attack on the We believe that the most important date of the Kremlin are to divide the West and to halt West and If the Kremlin should far to make sufficient progress toward that by short of general war and if in addition it should become convinced that its superiority in conventional were about to be offset through and West German or armament or through Western in unconventional we believe the Kremlin would consider the disability of precipitation gen real We believe it unlikely that the Kremlin would this course of action so long as Western armament to it only as a transistor impediment to further So and Satellite On the other if the Kremlin were to conclude that this armament the vital the we if it that the had sufficient to wage war successfully and that the delay would tip the scales of power irretrievably against the the Kremlin would precipitate general but it it did not have sufficient to wage war the Kremlin would modify its policy and attempt to relax international tension unto such time as the Western relaxed their vigilance or other favorable to the super It is that the might precipitate war even under adverse if it considered the threat to its vital sufficiently real and We do not believe that during the period of this estimate the Kremlin is likely to con that West and armament an ate threat to the vital of the It is that the Kremlin may at any time conclude that the Western rear program an eventual but al ready unacceptable threat to its vital There a serious possibility of general war within the period of this estimate from an action or series of not intended to produce that The Kremlin for the degree of risk involved in a particular action or underestimate the cumulative effect of real it might regard a particular action as so necessary or so advantageous as to warrant assuming even a serious risk of general We recognize the desirability and the importance of concluding this estimate with a simple and direct statement of the likelihood or likelihood that the Kremlin will deliver lately precipitate or provoke general war be teen the Up and the during the period here intelligence does not enable us to make such a precise The the capability to launch gen real war and may decide to precipitate general the international situation is so tense that at any time some issue might de below to a point beyond It is the view of the Director of Naval with respect to Section In that the final paragraph of this estimate should read as is that precise information on enemy is rarely available and that enemy contraction cannot be accurately all of the Soviet problem consider we believe it unlikely that the Will deliberately choose to precipitate or undergo the of general war during the period covered by this Although the possibility of war by miscalculation cannot be during of high international we believe that in various of action short of war with the the will seek to increase its power and damage the of the Up when ever and wherever but will at every turn attempt to exploit each course of action with such caution as avoid against the vital of the United

landing of f A landing the initial assault echelon succeed in seizing port by up to six This estimate does not consider opposition of naval or air to a Soviet assault upon See Annex for fuller

Soviet invasion of Japan is these would not in themselves necessarily be Since the outbreak of in the Soviet program to make the Soviet Far East logistical and mile family apparently been In view of the current readiness of the for military it is possible that there would be no of the for the assault except the final assembly of for combat which might be The Kremlin almost certainly that an assault on Japan would involve not only a local war with the in which the Up might well use atomic but also the strong probability of general war with the a Up strategic on the These cone would almost certainly result also from an assault on Japan by Communist and Soviet since such an assault could not be de lived without the participation of Soviet naval and air The might take the risk of precipitation general war if it forest an immediate threat to its vital We do not believe that the Kremlin is likely to conclude the sponsor armament alone its vital interest remainder of Authority It is the opinion of the majority of the of the Intelligence Advisory Committee Air Force and the Joint that an invasion of Japan might also result from a Kremlin decision to initiate general war on the

SOVIET CLANDESTINE ATTACK AGAIN THE Up IT Of MASS DESTRUCTION AND THE VULNERABILITY Of THE Up To ATTACK To THE PROBLEM To estimate for the period to the vulnerability of the Up to Soviet clandestine

of a number of atomic possibly by several The most likely method of because the most feasible and potential most would be the use of dis aircraft to deliver atomic to a number of simulate as the initial act of general the of this the term a attack on the us the would probably The delivery of atomic into key by merchant is feasible and therefore a serious Smuggling of atomic into the Up under

the Up by Delivery into Key by Merchant Atomic may be laid as underway mines in key by merchant or may be in the hold of the method is inherently if not to Laying an atomic weapon as a mine would require the of the weapon in a tight container and might also require special laying The is capable of meeting these as well as pro accurate anime to permit laying the weapon several or in advance of Detonation of an atomic weapon in the hold of a ship does not involve any special en engineering nor need the crew be aware of the presence of the While an atomic weapon exploded in the hold of a ship might not be as effective a un underwater the damage as well as the Authority contamination from radioactive mist would still be great with attendant disruption of normal port The Coast within the of

than sixty days after the transaction it is within Soviet to obtain and employ a foreign ship for time delivery before the Up could learn that the ship was under Soviet Finland is not included in the Coast whose to be a substantial part of shipping thought to be under must control Because of the above the must be considered capable of a chant ship for an atomic weapon into a key Up harbor with a relatively good chance of Smuggling of Atomic An atomic the fashionable can be broken into relatively small which could be separately over a period of time into the The various could be so that unusual handling would not be and radiation detection would be most Assembly the bomb would present certain but none of an innumerable Although it would be theoretically to manufacture clandestine within the These do not the additional Western in trade with the Soviet orbit but not under direct charter to the Soviet Authority Up all the of an atomic weapon with the exception of the fashionable it would be to procure and process the necessary it is unlikely that the would attempt the manual true of an atomic within the Smuggling under the Cover of Diplomatic Immunity Under cover of diplomatic for an atomic bomb less pro even an bomb could be con to Soviet diplomatic in the us as household effects or with out fear of inspection the Bureau of In no government agency is specifically the respond ability for observing the process and disposition of such method would require the closely effort of several in the Up to receive the weapon and it to the target It is Unlikely that such an would be even by constant sur of official Soviet in this Smuggling as Commercial It is feasible to smuggle an atomic bomb through customs a commercial and many of from the could be used as a for such an the number of in the Up so large that the of a new firm or a change in the of an old firm would not automatically arose the suspicion of the Customs The Bureau of Customs is well aware of the possibility of smuggling of a complete bomb Customs have been to watch for of the weight and size from within the Soviet orbit are par Although the Bureau of Customs is capable of of this type it would have considerable difficulty bomb there are numerous by which the could circumvent For commercial abroad received at and unsigned to other than the port of are usually with out customs to a bonded carrier for transportation to Customs section made just prior to final delivery to the but or en route is such method would involve elaborate as well as the existence within the Up of an efficient organization to establish dummy corporal subvert of bonded These greatly increase the risk of While it would be feasible for the to ship an atomic bomb as part of a shipment from a neutral the would have to resort to one or more thereby increasing the number of involved and the risk of Because of the complexity of the slug going the risk of and the availability of simpler and more secure it is considered relatively improbable that the endeavor to smuggle an atomic weapon into the Up under the guise of a commercial Smuggling into Secluded Coastal and Border A more serious well within Soviet is the smuggling of an atomic especially if from a Soviet port into an isolated section of the plate security coverage of all coastal and bor is practically Such a smuggling operation could involve the of a bomb from a chant vessel or submarine to a small boat which would bring it Here it could be loaded into a truck for assembly and subset quest delivery to the target area and possible detonation in the This would be the most difficult to detect of those which require the assistance of personnel within the Up The weapon would be in the of Soviet personnel at all times and would not come under the direct scrutiny of Authority the requirement for several completely reliable within the some of must possess coal might be a partial deter rent to the use of this The of time Navy and Air Force for air and sea will re main limited until these are ing on an expanded wartime Coast Guard shore are very limited in the Coast Guard all lifeboat and light to the threat of uncover across and iso later and and solicited civilian intelligence in this emphasis on active surveillance and boarding of small craft at inlet No plan yet been for the detection and prevention of the smuggling of atomic into the Up at secluded Until such a plan is plated and put into effective the will team vulnerable to this Merchant It is that the type with of at least which could be from merchant or Such could operate at low and could have considerably better accuracy than German operational of World War While there is no conclusive evidence that the an atomic suitable for use in a the construction of such a is to be within A Soviet merchant ship or submarine could reach its position with little chance of detection by radio hence and normal shipping this method of clandestine attack well for employment of atomic against critical key Intense air and sea would be to minimize this Clandestine Attack With Chemical Warfare The term as herein re to those toxic chemical suitable for employment in mass for cal These to be listing from the almost countless number of poisonous chemical which readily available to Soviet personnel from medical and are suitable for contact rating food and water and for poison ing key of such commercial is considered to be con sectional sabotage and is not included this Although the have large stockpile of standard C these are not well for clandestine attack and their employment for that purpose is highly The C most likely to be used for clandestine attack are the nerve and primarily because of their extreme toxicity greater than that of other known C The probably sufficient of nerve gas for fully extensive clandestine at In common atomic nerve are not for employment prior to inasmuch as their tic physiological effects would their idea notification as enemy action relatively and are colorless which become effective when dispersed as a fog or an invisible is approximately three times more toxic than The initial characteristic physics logical effects of and are contraction of the pupil of the switching blur ring of brightness of the chest and cult in Exposure to a lethal generation usually death within an About of a lethal concentrate is sufficient to cause incapacitation for several In the persistence of nerve is a matter of rather than In clandestine it would not be able to build up the for employment against population or Authority other of a sizable clandestine attack is well for employ against personnel in key when the is immediate of a high percentage of and physical destruction of the installation an atomic weapon is not Soviet orbit or in a diplomatic Both the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Customs are well aware of this but ad that it is practically impossible to insure of such a Effective clandestine attack against per sonnet in key would require case timing and in relatively small of nerve Nerve gas may be effectively either in a building or in its immediate The most likely method of dissemination within a building would be by of aerosol bomb Similar to those used for insect and with a time When throughout a confined space of cubic about pound of would produce a concentration lethal to about percent of the people exposed for If in the nerve will easily penetrate most under proper weather A medium size could be successfully with one ton of from a vehicle with a compressed air source and adequate The only method of clandestine attack likely to be employed by the would be the smuggling of nerve gas into the Up for dissemination by While under sent internal security the Up is vol notable to this method of the necessity of upon personnel in the Up might deter the from going nerve gas into the The available to the for smuggling nerve gas into the Up correspond with those already in connection with clandestine atomic smuggling through or introduction at a point outside Customs In all the successful smuggling of nerve gas or the complete aero sol dispenser would be considerably Nerve gas could be easily disguised as one of any number of commercial from the The most important phase of protection against clandestine attack with nerve is the local security of key governmental install as provided by special and military Except at a very present inspection of entering and of adjacent is inadequate to prevent clandestine attack with nerve During the next at there will be no test to provide automatic warning of the presence of nerve The standard military gas mask protect against or in vapor form except in higher than those to be key with specialized air little promise as a source of additional These are prohibitive in size and cost and are not completely The effects of nerve gas may be reduced by prompt recognition of the unique of atropine within a few of and artificial respiration combined with oxy Clandestine Attack With Biological Warfare Biological warfare is the employment of living their toxic or chemical plant growth

a variety of By in sufficient for extensive clandestine employment against and Authority The level of knowledge of the and their for By are at least equal to those of the By are a new and tried and evidence of their effectiveness is based solely on limited experience and In biological warfare a lar ger degree of uncertainty than any other weapon of mass This might be a deterrent to Soviet employment of against On the other the might consider this de torrent would be by our limited defensive experience and by the isolated geo graphic location of the Up which would offer an excellent By Many of By are for clandestine and could be employed by the even well in advance of as part of an plan to impair the mile try effectiveness of the In contrast to clandestine attack with atomic and chemical clandestine employment of certain By would entail much less risk of identification as enemy Very small of would be Such would be impossible to detect when being brought into this country

that widespread of disease could also be brought about by contamination the and other biological in the Up for the insulation of I the manufacture Of these production are continued over a long period of time and government and physical security of product and are In a clandestine attack against foot and mouth disease the most serious threat to this The disease is highly there is a relatively long period during which animal is capable of other before the become apparent to anyone but an The occurrence of a By attack against would be extremely difficult to or even identify as enemy The Department of Agriculture is of this threat and special have been dis nominated to its county and other field The Department of Agriculture can be to isolate and eradicate resultant of any known animal with the possible exception of foot and mouth It is that the might em ploy clandestine By attack against Up even in advance of any Although such could be carried out with relative ease and

rust to which are not resistant and disseminate their over wheat under cover of darkness with a Depending on especially favorable weather and other unpredictable this might continue to spread and attack both winter and spring wheat over a large Other possible By which might be effective against Up to a lesser degree include causing tomato potato it is considered that the of an attack with

within a few of Commerce U would restrict the which exist for the use of small by for spray It is that the might silly employ some of cereal rust in a By attack against Up such attack is unlikely because of the uncertainty that this disease would spread over a wide the event of attack this there would be no risk of starve or a direct adverse effect upon the war because of the abundance and

capability of the Up to wage offensive The scale and nature of the Soviet effort against the Up would not be significantly affected by possible simultaneous Soviet military in other The would not avoid any weapon and tactic because of Up for retaliation in Authority SECRET DISCUSSION MILITARY ATTACK Air Attack Atomic bombardment with aircraft is the most effective among the various of potential surprise air against the Up within Soviet during the period considered in this other possible of surprise air such as con sectional with high from territory and the employment of free will not constitute a serious threat during the period of this Although chemical and biological might be by these are to clandestine or sabotage It is considered unlikely that the will possess a hydrogen

extend the range of a mission and enable Soviet to reach any important target in the Up even from interior from Verbal Eastern could be carried out against the small segment of the Up northwest of One aerial refueling would extend this radius to include an arc passing through and Two aerial re would extend this radius to include an arc run from to Cape Combat Crew Proficiency Soviet Long Range Aviation no background combat ex experience such as that acquired by the Up and the Up strategic air during World War An intensive training program to overcome in instrument and high altitude flying and electronics been under way for some Soviet could be by navigational if they were successful in gaining tactical could use Up radio and other navigational to facilitate target and bomb Al though it is that Soviet blind equipment and I I Authority flying are not up to Up it is that Soviet combat crew proficiency and equipment performance are such as to permit an attempt by the to carry out strategic air against the Atomic Attack The limiting factor in the scale of atomic attack would be the stockpile of available to the for use against the The atomic stockpile for and been as The above stockpile must be considered as uncertain for the following The number size of the production in this may be in The minimum which is not inconsistent with the information would provide a about the

OFFENSIVE AGAIN THE THE PROBLEM To assess the psychological of the Soviet people distinguished from the Communist to a Up strategic air both atomic and conventional ESTIMATE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS Of STRATEGIC In WORLD AR There is but little evidence on the Soviet reaction to German bomb ing during World War and consequently not much basis for the probable psychological effects of heavy Up strategic air with atomic Since the Soviet people are it may be that their reaction would be different from that of the or who were subjected to the strategic air during the recent certain might be drawn from German and in particular since the totalitarian social and political structure of these two was broadly comparable to that of the Soviet While strategic was secondary to front line in de pressing Axis it had a serious adverse It was the principal of affecting directly the morale of the had a less adverse effect on party mem the bureaucracy and closely with the regime than it did on the remainder of the Authority The initial reaction of all to Allied was some antagonism toward the but neither in nor Japan did it in the longer run apparently increase hatred of the there is no evidence that Allied the population to rally closer around the Instead any popular to focus on resentment toward the regime for failing to protect the population adequately against How in the a country which was not exposed to air bombardment on the same scale as and the effect of German was apparently increase antagonism toward the attacker and to contribute to greater will to German and propaganda to counteract the psychological impact of Allied particularly early German to minimize the were largely and only popular resentment toward the under continued heavy the population to become and and their emotional to become The atomic of and evidently pro used sheer fear and terror among the local together with awe at the power of the Up their effect on over all morale was limited because other had already severely depressed morale and popular and because news of the had not had time to exert its effect before the German of the in World War In was on a limited Since evidence on this is it no adequate basis for the probable Soviet reaction to heavy atomic it apparently did not especially affect popular feeling toward the As a rule when military were the Soviet people to accept this as an inevitable part of although there to have been some resentment against the government for failure to meet the situation Authority PROBABLE IMPACT Of STRATEGIC Of SOVIET POPULAR MORE The most significant psychological effect on the Soviet people of a Up air would be its impact on popular It is extremely difficult to separate the probable impact of on morale from that of other important which would operate on Soviet popular and the morale effects of Up air offensive would depend upon a multitude of complex and closely interrelated these would the psychological preparation of the Soviet particularly for atomic the general state of popular morale at the time of these the severity and extensiveness of the Up air offensive and the target Soviet military the effect of on popular toward the Up and the and the success of Soviet propaganda in con the popular While the Soviet people are generally aware of atomic warfare and of the likelihood they would be bombed in Soviet prop agenda carefully concealed the potential effects of a Up air offensive and continually the effectiveness of the atomic while some civil defense are apparently there are few of civil defense against atomic which would serve to increase public aware ness of the of their use in air Because of these plus the limited Soviet civilian experience of wartime ing and lack of experience of atomic the Soviet public is probably psychologically unprepared for intensive atomic The psychological impact of strategic air would also largely depend on the general level of popular In general we that the and divisive in the Soviet social fabric and the lack of popular identification with the all of which contribute to a relatively low morale among large seg of the also create a favorable psychological climate for a further decline in morale under heavy air a Authority distinction must be made between the civilian population as a whole and those who are closely with the regime party the the and probably most Soviet military present morale is markedly we believe that heavy widespread Up air largely with mass destruction would undoubtedly have a sharply depressing effect on civilian although we cannot assess how much this might be offset by other positive The shock effect of mass destruction would be particularly Heavy atomic would be likely to produce disorder and panic in target and milder but substantial indirect effects in largely de pending on the transmission of news and rumor and the degree of personal involvement The impact on the morale of different would probably vary according to their experience of their peacetime morale and their attitude the The sheer size of the would probably lead to a dilution of any indirect morale effects in remote from the bombed Party the and with the regime would probably maintain higher morale and show continued determination to resist the On the other the apathy of the unskilled and would probably grow more acute under widespread heavy The morale of urban would obviously decline more than that of rural as they would be most likely to be and consequently the most It is possible that the who are in general antagonistic toward the might derive some satisfaction at on the to which they are forced to send their grain and which probably appear to them as alien and The decline in Soviet morale resulting from Up air might be offset somewhat by various Any extensive Soviet land or heavy retaliatory air would tend to bolster Soviet Both of these would i l Authority be more indirect and less immediate in their than the impact of heavy air Devastation and destruction actually experienced would be more important in popular Should the Soviet citizen become convinced that he was fighting a patriotic war against the attacker and should Up air increase antagonism toward the attacker Soviet will to fight would also be unless Up air were to disrupt seriously the of Kremlin any adverse impact on Soviet popular morale would be at least in the to be a major obstacle to Soviet ability to wage If Soviet control were seriously the Kremlin might be unable to prevent a decline in morale under Up air from materially affecting Soviet war PROBABLE EFFECTS Of SOVIET POPULAR TOWARD THE Up AND THE KREMLIN An important psychological effect of a Up air and part of its impact on Soviet would be its effect on Soviet popular toward the Up and the This would also depend to a great extent upon the attendant surrounding Up such as the target the success of Soviet propaganda in the popular and Up psychological warfare over a of the adverse morale effects of destructive Up would gradually dull any initial Soviet popular toward the Up or the As in and these would become submerged in the general and preoccupation with personal which appear to result eventually from widespread and devastating air We are unable to predict at what point this condition would be but it would appear to be an eventual result of such air Authority Effect on popular toward the Up air would probably cause an initial growth of hostility toward the particularly among bombed but we doubt whether over the longer run they would produce widespread popular hatred of the To some extent at least Soviet would tend realistically and even fatalistically to accept Up as one of the of the fairly general lack of strong sentiment among the people and difficulty of building up hatred for the Up is by the Soviet as by their extensive postwar propaganda campaign to build up The reaction to air would be much among most closely with the which might contribute to greater Soviet will to The development of a strong reaction among the general would largely depend upon Soviet success in convincing the people that the Up was the and was atrocity and Effect on popular toward the On the other we consider it likely that much of the initial hostility toward the Up might be to the extent that Soviet defense were by an antagonism toward the German and experience in the last war that to the extent the government to provide adequate protection to the people and to minimize the extent of the it popular If Soviet propaganda to underway Up air it might well The popular by air which would have little let against the would probably be finally on domestic and fellow particularly if Soviet were We consider it unlikely that Up would in itself cause the Soviet people to rally closer to the at least in the long The considerable apathy toward the Kremlin which among the population and the wide gap already separating the people from their military against any such Only if the pop nation were convinced that the was fighting a patriotic war of i Authority defense against outside aggression would there probably be any growth in popular support for the On the other various minority antagonistic toward the regime might be by Up air as a prelude to possible would be unlikely to incite them to rebel the unless Soviet broke Effect of the use of atomic While the Kremlin tried to incite popular antipathy toward atomic and would probably play this up in event of Up atomic we are un able to say whether use of mass destruction would in itself create antagonism toward the Up over the longer Any unique reaction to atomic might be more likely to take the form of an adverse effect Most Soviet probably realistically accept that a war would be waged with all available On the other Soviet propaganda would un undoubtedly make much of Up and use of and might succeed in initially on the popular in particular by on population Effect of choice of The popular reaction would probably be more sharply antagonistic if as well as purely mile try were particularly with atomic Soviet propaganda would stress destruction of as it did in World War In and the on purely military or key industrial would be realistically understood by the as in World War and would probably have a on popular in many particularly where these were in and where an area weapon like an atomic bomb was it would be difficult for the people to distinguish the object of the To the extent that Up propaganda could identify the in any particular popular antagonism might be it clear that atomic on population would at least temporarily arose antagonism toward the although we are unable to assess how significant this an agonist might Authority There are conflicting as the probable popular re to on of symbolic or cultural such as or Undoubtedly such would create some although many Soviet might under stand the significance of the of Soviet There was a strong local Soviet reaction to German destruction of key and national in the last particularly when this purely and Soviet propaganda would un undoubtedly stress this Effect of popular belief that Up or was the We are convinced that the would attempt by every to pin the label of aggression on the The Soviet regime is already systematically to prepare the population for possible war by an increasing propaganda campaign against the To the extent that surrounding the beginning of a war permitted the Kremlin to convince the people that the Up was the pop lar antagonism the Up and patriotic would pro able Under these the people would probably react more at least to Up air depending on the patriotic fervor which the could On the other widespread popular belief that the was the aggression would minimize the effectiveness of Soviet propaganda about Up air might reduce any antagonism against the and could also increase resentment toward the regime if it inadequately the people from Up Popular toward official would undoubtedly greater logical warfare for the The would also make every propaganda effort to convince the people that the Up the first atomic If the Soviet public that the the first they would be prone to expect retaliation in Authority SOVIET PROPAGANDA ACTION To Up The Soviet government would doubtless seek by all available prop panda to minimize the adverse morale effects of Up air and to utilize these to create patriotic anger at the Soviet propaganda would probably seek whip up popular anger at Up and while and the damage and it by up Soviet either real or and on from its during World War the Soviet propaganda would devote much attention to us and use of such as the atomic The actual effectiveness of Up would be and the defensive of the maximize in order to bolster faith in victory and conceal the actual of Up air Although the effectiveness of Soviet propaganda will depend on number intangible such as the success of Soviet the extent of Up the spread of news by rumor and Up and popular as to who is the we believe that it would be unable to counteract a decline in The spreading of news through the grapevine would reduce the impact of official censorship and propaganda although it is difficult to tell to what The success of to minimize the damage would be largely dependent upon the extent and nature of the Up Once knowledge of these it would be difficult to minimize adverse German to hide the effects of from the people boomerang and considerable News and apparently spread rapidly in the where the people tend to be of official The Soviet news blackout on the German advance into the in was apparently unsuccessful and accurate information spread rapidly by the Optimistic official propaganda will be more widely as in and it is at variance with personal and tales by may actually exaggerated the effects of air Authority it must be that because of the nature of the Soviet propaganda Soviet propaganda might have significant success in building up antagonism toward the Up as a result of Up air particularly if the Soviet people could be convinced the Up was the The might also be able to capitalize on and Up To this extent the Kremlin might at least temporarily be able to offset some of the adverse morale effects of a Up air Of Up PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE Despite the obvious handicap under which they would be forced to we believe that skillful Up psychological warfare especially prior might contribute materially to Soviet propaganda and reducing the antagonism toward the Up resulting from Up air Depending upon the skill and effectiveness with which it was Up propaganda that the Up is fighting to free the Soviet people from their terrorist and is seeking only to destroy Soviet war potential might to some extent reduce the Up reaction to Up air It would be most attractive to various disaffected On the other widespread on population rather than production probably would produce step racism over this propaganda to the extent that Up propaganda can get through to the Soviet people with accurate news about the and effectiveness of Up air it would tend to counter Soviet propaganda In prior Up might to some extent reduce the popular Up reaction to Up air They would also signify the impression of Up air superiority if the were actually and successfully carried Emphasis in the on the fact that the Up were directed against the potential and not against the people would be A warning program could give the Up a reputation for humanity and fairness which would tend to size popular resentment against the if inadequate defense were to increase resentment against the As were people would pay more attention to Up while Soviet propaganda their invisibility and brutality might be largely Authority The effectiveness of would depend on the specific and de tailed nature of the and given and on whether the were actually carried German to the Soviet population in World War In

Strategic Significance of the Soviet Bloc The Soviet economy is already at a high state of war readiness and it is that its productive capacity is at such a level and of such a character as to enable

production of new and proved military Moreover there been increasing emphasis throughout the entire economy on strengthening military through technological and proved industrialization in the and

THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE Of THE AR AST To THE THE PROBLEM To assess the immediate and long range strategic importance of the Far East to the The numerous and sub spatial military and economic van from the of the Far East now under Communist This con tenuous land mass valuable bases for against the Far East and for further political penetration of adjacent and also defense in depth to the it a potential and con though largely re of strategic raw The loss of Communist control over any would be re garden by the as a blow to its and the loss in particular of North the For the of till it is assumed that the and Communist China will inmate any in their strategic assessment of the various of the Far East to the pursuit of their common against the An estimate of possible divergence between and Keeping is in t Throughout the the term Far will be used when to South the and Southeast and The term will include the as well as must North and the Soviet Far East of and the Lake northernmost part of would be re garden as a threat to its The expansion of Communist control over all of would provide the with the most favorable base for against Japan and would deny the West its last foothold on the Northeast Communist control of would not only eliminate the last territorial stronghold of China and the threat which the island now as a base for possible military against but would de drive the West of a link in the offshore island chain and increase Communist for against other island the expansion of Communist control into Southeast would be of limited immediate Over the long Communist control over Southeast early if extended to include and the could be of great military importance to the From an economic point of con tool of Southeast would be of con miserable strategic importance to the by increasing their Authority R D for the West through food and Japan and to Japan and the of the Short of such denial would have most series because Western would find it difficult to adopt sufficiently drastic emergency In time of general the West would initially suffer less through such than it did during World War is to estimate in the event of a The is a winning requirement for the De of access this rubber would obliged the to on stockpile now be lived to Such denial over a pro longer period create serious pro less for the access to petroleum and possibly other Southeast would be important the conduct of a prolong war by the and would be even more to a major industrial expansion in Far I I t in to Of the Far eastern not now un Japan is of the trauma importance the the potent till threat to military inter in the and is a key element of the Up defeat line in the Western Pa despite serious in food and raw would be an addition to must because it the only substantial the pool of trained and ad Far it would be an element in the real station of the potential for long plant and range development into a largely power The possibility of such a pow er complex is probably an important tor in Soviet If such a complex were it would in time of war greatly the ability of the to maintain sustained and large scale military in the Far it would add greatly to the Soviet potential for re mining Up Pacific and for at against the Up and The would encounter import want but not economic and political in such a power complex in the Far East even after it control over all of the In time of the de development of this complex would almost certainly require a decade or in wartime little progress toward that de development could be in its assessment of the strategic importance of the Far the is probably more by than by consider Any partial expansion in this in addition to materially increasing Communist for gaining con tool of the entire have such within the framework of strengthen ing the Soviet global position relative to that of the Up Pacific Western and Western to strengthen and the Middle By is meant a country or group of closely associated with an aggregate of and military strength client to exert a significant influence on the world power Authority DISCUSSION Geographic of Strategic Importance The Far East is far from the major Soviet power in western and central A single railroad an inadequate chant and air transport over vast dis provide the only of community between Russia and poor presently limit the direct contribution either region can make to the The security of the of Soviet pow er west of Lake cannot easily be threat end from Far Eastern now in must is secure from ground invasion from the That part of the most vulnerable to from the Far East area from Lake probably con less than percent of the prim ary industrial capacity Map Strategic Importance of Now Under Communist Control riding defense in depth for the Soviet Far air bases which permit long range aircraft to strike at the Tai the the main land Southeast and all the ex eastern and southern of the In Map long coast line also potential for naval especially submarine which could extend the naval in the From a of the coast of China could impose a formidable commitment upon the in view of the very limited Communist naval Communist large and fairly well army and air force are an important to Soviet in the Far In the event of general the enormous population of China would sup ply the with a tremendous pool of for either labor or military The amount of drawn into the military would be sub to by the require of the economy and the ability of China and the to equip such man The maintenance and consolidation of the present Communist position in the Far East is probably the most important consideration in the strategic assessment of that Over and above any positive strategic provided by must the loss of Communist control over any presently would be re garden by the as a blow to its and the loss in particular of North the northernmost part of would be as a threat to its Soviet Far East and China now under Communist control pro video the Kremlin with numerous and sub spatial strategic The Soviet Far East the with air and naval bases from which can be against South and the Communist in addition to Both the Soviet Far East and Communist China have natural most of which have not yet been fully but which are even now an important role in increasing the Communist war potential in the Far Large of coal are in the Soviet Far East and in must There are abundant of iron ore in China and probably also in the Soviet Far China is already a large part of the Soviet for and and of nickel and copper are in the Soviet Far This area also large lumber Oil exist in the Soviet Far East and in Northwest The almost certainly main penance of Communist control over at least large of North as of great topic Loss of the northernmost Authority R El part of would be by the as a threat to the security and a blow to the prestige of both the and must On the other must control over all of would furnish the with the most favorable base for an attack on and would provide defense in depth for North and Soviet Far Strategic Importance of Political currently give special significance to Con tool of the island would also provide the with some economic principal significance from the threat that it now to the Comma as a base for military against China or on Communist ship Communist control of would not only eliminate this threat but would de drive the West of a link in the offshore island chain and increase Communist for against such other island bases as and the Southeast the expansion of Communist control into Southeast would be of limited immediate Communist control of Southeast would provide defense in depth to southern but present Communist capability for making use of even the few naval and air bases in Southeast is overland and sea community with bases in the area would be invade quote and would be vulnerable to Western Even if control were extended to the and the could gain few immediate military van because neither the nor the island area of Southeast a sig pool of trained military or more than a negligible munitions production Defense of all Southeast would present formidable because of the great and quote Soviet and insignificant must naval and merchant and the to strong de from the present of China and the Soviet Far Over the long many of these could be overcome and Communist control over the entire area would provide great military ad vantage because such control would provide protection of communication in Southeast and advanced bases for fur offensive action in the South Pacific and Ocean to In their short run strategic assessment of Southeast the toss is probably more by the immediate to be by the West access to the area than by military which would to Southeast is currently the major Western source of natural and as well as a secondary source of hard and It is also a major source of food for and Short of general the Western would have most serious in to the loss of Southeast sup because they would find it difficult to adopt the necessary emergency By the same the loss of dollar earnings would be a severe the Up and indirectly to the The consequent that would be in the strategic material and in the balance of pay of the could result in a serious setback in the of In time of general the West would also face if it were access to Southeast raw mater although the initial would be less serious than in World War In as are suit of new technical in conservation and and access to alternative of It is to estimate the effects in the event of a The economic and political which the would derive from control over Southeast would increase as a Japan more Authority Of pendant on the and raw of this The could also use their domination of Southeast to prove their position with other For must control over Southeast food surplus and raw could serve as a lever to bring into closer association with the Communist world and to obtain re taxation of Western export On the other the immediate time economic contribution Southeast could make to the Soviet and must would be limited by the fact like the Soviet Far East and Southeast is a raw material and capital the rubber of Southeast is a re requirement for Denial of access to this rubber would obliged the to draw on stockpile now to exist and over a pro longer period would create serious for the At the and Communist China are few other strategic from Southeast Present Soviet import of tin can be met from Communist the rice surplus of Southeast are nor mall not urgently by Communist China or the Soviet Far Access to the and possibly other of Southeast would be important to the conduct of a war by the and would be even more important to a major industrial expansion in a Communist Far Japan Of the of the Far Japan is of the strategic import to the and Communist Japan the potential threat to Communist military in the Far Japan is the principal operational base for Up prosecution of More from operational bases in the dominate to the Soviet Far East and northern China and could attack by air or sea all major industrial and military in the of the Far As long as Japan the Up with military the ability of the to attack the Up from the Soviet Far East would be sharply under Communist con Japan would pose the threat to the Up position in the Western Japan also the only economy in the Far East as well as the pool of skilled tech and Its steel pro auction capacity is nearly percent that of the it considerable for the construction of naval and merchant in it could a sub spatial aircraft and munitions The industrial in the Soviet Far and though small in re nation to that of the only other important industrial in the Far A Communist Japan could play a key role in the development of the Common ist economy and could supply Southeast for consumer and capital exploitation of industrial plant would require of iron col ing and available in as well as such other raw as and rubber from Southeast Regional Potential for Development into Power Complex The addition of virtually all must Far East to Communist would provide the with a combine of potentially and over the long could be into a strong industrial and military base largely indeed economically of western and central and capable of a significant influence on the world power Creation of such a power complex would greatly enhance the ability of the Common its to maintain sustained large scale military in the Far Communist con tool of the region would deny the of the area to the and would add Authority mostly to Soviet prestige throughout the such a by greatly to Soviet for Up Pacific and for against the Up and would pose a severe additional drain on Up Even if the were able to se cure control of the entire Far Eastern area without provoking a general they would probably require at least a after such control had been to de below such a power complex The area might be short of petroleum for some time even with full access to De sentence on western and central and on the world for certain raw such as cotton and for highly industrial could not be quickly With the exception of the region is deficient in and skilled industrial Above owing to economic dependence on both China and Southeast full realization of the potential would require construction of a large merchant as well as the naval and air strength to defend the long and vol notable of ocean communication Map In time of all of these could be but only after of The creation of a Far Eastern power complex would also con front with the though not problem of working out the future of the Communist and a Communist A must Japan and Communist China would almost certainly vie with each other for lead ship in the Communist movement as well as in the exploitation of the more back ward of the Far The fact that Japan would be a primary industrial base of the Communist Far combined with modern experience with a would threaten position and influence in the Static Communist The problem of de or of influence could strain as well as Soviet Thus in the Far the would be with control far more difficult than those it in the small of Eastern Vast inadequate and the of enormous on undeveloped would further comply cate the problem of effective con tool over the region and the emergence of independent Communist move Despite these the is probably in its long range strategic assessment of the Far East by the potential for being into largely power must expansion into any area of the Far East would materially increase Communist strength in the area and Communist cap for gaining control of the entire re and thus would be a step toward achieve of this power of The Role in Current In addition to being by these strictly Far Eastern the is probably more in its strategic assessment of the area because of the poor which it in the framework for strengthening the Soviet global strategic po in the Far East are far oracle to the Kremlin in its campaign to di video and weaken the The fighting in and throughout South east as well as such the Jap these Peace Treaty and the recognition of Communist can be in an fort to

willing to commit such because of the inherent of precise taking general unless the present unrestricted Communist air is checked or we be live the growing power of the Communist even without direct commitment of Soviet will enable them to deal severe damage to the Up and may make it impossible for the Up to conduct general offensive opera except at prohibitive Prolongation of the war in at

that so long as the war the are unlikely to engage in mile try against or We believe that the de sire a suspension or termination of hostile in but that their present po is not such as to obliged them

throughout the It is probable that Soviet Air Force personnel are operating aircraft accredited to the Air Force Logistics The Communist and North Air are wholly dependent upon the for spare and also equipment and largely dependent upon Soviet for It is within the Soviet capability to augment greatly the air strength at any These aircraft could come from the Soviet Far East Air from or from Soviet production which is to include per Within a relatively short period of time large part of the T and E strength of aircraft in the Soviet Far East Air Force could be made avail able for operation in

Communist in with a large share of the replace of munitions and other equipment for military and air as well as trained personnel for instruct and and operation aircraft and Munitions and equipment can probably be from Soviet stocks or current production without a strain on the Since a spatial part of these must be sent to the Far East from western and central the war doubt a heavy burden on the

a strong fighter defense for this The fighter defense of China proper are considerably less should real of China be simultaneous the presently would be spread too thinly for effective their present in Military Through the Comma can maintain troop strength and combat potential in As suing that the present ratio of Up Comma list air effectiveness remains the could deploy and finally support in to

troop strength in to approximately On the other an increase in the effectiveness of the Up interdiction effort would make difficult even a moderate increase in Communist troop It is unlikely that within the few the effectiveness of Communist now in could be substantially by the receipt of of heavy equipment Although the the capability to make available substance till of heavy equipment to must in these would require considerable further training to use such equipment The aircraft strength presently available to the Communist operating in could be by to a level de pendant only on Soviet and

believe it unlikely that the Kremlin will deliberately initiate gen real war during We believe that the Kremlin to pursue its through short of deliberate re sort to war with the Up and its and probably that through such will continue to exist through We believe that in these circus the Kremlin is likely to be de from a deliberate resort to war with the Up and its allies in by the certainty of extensive destruction in the for progress as well as by the risk that the Soviet system might be We the grave danger of a general war in resulting from a Kremlin action or series of not intended to have that re or even from in the that but not the certainty We recognize also the danger that general war might arise from which the Kremlin intended to limit to a particular DISCUSSION GENERAL Soviet The principal immediate Soviet evidently To divide the To consolidate and extend Soviet power and influence wherever the period under consideration to offer the best To prevent West and d To prevent implementation of the Up We believe the in pursuit of its object will during the period of this Seek to maintain an advanced state of and offset any increase in the of the Up and its Seek to prevent the development of any threat to the vital of the or to Soviet control of the Authority Seek to expand the territorial of the Soviet d Seek to undermine and secure control of not yet under Soviet Seek to force of the free world to adopt a policy of neutrality in the East West struggle and to deny their strategic to the Up and its The Place of War in Soviet Strategy The basic strategy under which the lin to have in the past the following The preservation of the established must the is essential to provide a secure base and strong support for rev in other In revolution in other is necessary for the prefer nation and completion of the revolution in the No permanent accommodation is possible between this State and the capitalist The doctrine of the impossibility of peaceful between communism and capital ism and the inevitability of ultimate rightful collision before one side or the other remains in that it is subject to ire conceivable within itself the of its own class economic colonial a will weaken the capitalist world and create revolutionary The must provoke and exploit such through political if through the use of Soviet mile try A grave danger and always will exist that the capitalist alarmed by the rising revolutionary will unite to attack and destroy the Political warfare as here used all manner of political and economic action in the Up and propaganda and front Communist Party and trade union support of all of revolutionary and biological The must seek to avoid the final world struggle until capitalist power been sufficiently but must be ready at all times to assume the offensive if the nation should warrant Recent Soviet suggest that the Soviet believe that the between capitalism and an advanced stage in which the world is divided into two and that the West camp is now seeking not only to prevent the spread of the but also to de story the It would be unsafe to take these Soviet as an infallible guide to Soviet of action in the The is a totalitarian state and experience that totalitarian are subject to internal and compulsion which may without in the use of foreign war as an instrument of national use of war for this purpose can probably be better than been the case with respect to other totalitarian in modern Soviet of action can never be with In particular the possibility of deliberate of general war cannot be at any time merely because such initiation would contradict past Soviet political Fur the possibility of deliberate initiation of war cannot be even the it certain that the of the would be better by other of While Soviet theory and practice offer no sure guide as to when and under what the would deliberately re sort war against the Up and its they no doubt that the is the impact able enemy of the While in Soviet theory and practice war is an and on occasion in student for Communist the Kremlin presumably if possible to attain its by of action short of resort to general Soviet and practice suggest that it would probably resort to armed attack at any time Authority I u are such that the re garden the situation as highly or No other method available to counter what the Kremlin considered a threat to the preservation of the THE KREMLIN DELIBERATELY AR AGAIN THE Up AND Allied In Involved and Uncertainty of Outcome The Kremlin probably that in the initial phase of a general war begun in Soviet and could seize and hold extensive and important of and and thereby enhance the power It might also estimate that it at the very deliver an atomic attack on the continental Up of suffix client strength to reduce materially the Up capability for Soviet the Kremlin would probably not ex pet a Soviet atomic attack on the continental Up to eliminate the threat of atomic counter attack and prevent the mobilization of the Up industrial and military It is impossible to estimate the conclusion with regard to the relative effect likeness of Soviet and Up atomic warfare ca or with regard to the relative importance of atomic and conventional in the issue of a The lin would undoubtedly expect the West to re act to Soviet initiation of a general war by an immediate atomic attack on the Soviet with consequent widespread We that the Kremlin probably that the could survive this attack and maintain sup ancient relative strength to carry on the The Kremlin might believe that after the had extended the under its con tool and the initial allied it could notify its and mobilize It might calculate that the economic and other from Up would be offset by the industrial and man power it had acquired in and While the Kremlin would its less anticipate in and firm control over the and would also anticipate internal its whole concept of state power that it would expect to cope success fully with these In these the Kremlin might estimate that the resulting Soviet power po would deter the West from attempt ing to recover the overrun by the the Kremlin might believe that the loss of and Static might make it impossible for the Up to carry the war through to a successful The Kremlin would undoubtedly expect the Up government to be extremely tenacious forceful in its attempt to prosecute the even if support from and and subjected to increasing domestic pressure for it might estimate that as the war dragged on opposition in the Up to the war might rise to the point where the people would refuse to make the necessary for the continuance of the conflict and thereby obliged the government to accept a compromise On the other the Kremlin would have to recognize despite initial Soviet at least a substantial portion of the power potential of the Up would and probably would in time be and brought to bear in a continuation of the In these the lin would expect to be faced with of such magnitude at the to make the war long and costly to the The Kremlin would to in this whether or not it could survive the psychological and military of a war of The Director of Naval Intelligence would add at this point the following weighing this the Kremlin would have to recognize the grave danger that in a pro longer war of attrition the would be subjected to persistent and growing air atomic possibly resulting in serious comic and the disruption of Soviet ad administrative and police With regard to the Kremlin would have to continued at bottom of next Authority In view of the it cannot be as that the Kremlin would necessarily ex pet to suffer defeat in a war with the Up in stated in the Kremlin would probably estimate that such a war would be a hazardous gamble on its in at a minimum the certainty of wide spread destruction in the and at the same time carrying with it the risk that the Soviet itself would be uncertainty would probably make the lin reluctant deliberately to initiate a general war in that current and future economic particularly in the Up and and di percent and among the Western may prevent the establish of a position of strength in the Furthermore these may make Western increasingly susceptible to various possible Soviet the the relaxation of trade exploitation of the fear of and intimidation by the display of mil and may make possible the growth of the Communist movement in the For Soviet By Short of Deliberate Initiation of General War The Kremlin probably that will continue to at least ing the period of this for both its immediate and by short of the deliberate initiation of war against the Up and its Communist doctrine the strategic importance of the especially in Southeast and the Middle which are as a vital bearing on the world power these under Soviet or at least their assets to the is as one of the most important in parking for the final phase of the world At present the Kremlin probably in the instability of these favorable for early Communist Although probably that it little chance in of making territorial gains in without deliberate resort to general the Kremlin probably weigh the logistical and security of main across broad of adequate support and control of extended Soviet the danger of the ideological con nomination of Soviet occupation the ability of widespread guerrilla probably and directed by the perhaps most the possibility that Allied bridge on the Continent might be throughout the initial phase of the and might in time be built up sufficiently to permit a major counter INDUCE THE KREMLIN DELIBERATELY To INITIATE GENERAL AR In view of the above we live it unlikely that the Kremlin would de deliberately initiate general war during solely for the purpose of expanding the area under its With respect to China we believe that the would react to the pro aggressive expansion of the present conflict in by giving aid to the even to the extent of Soviet and thereby a de war between the Up and the in the Far but would probably not deliberately in state general the Kremlin that a Western attack on the were imminent and and that Soviet of surviving such attack would be by seizing the initiative and it would almost certainly do We have no way of knowing what interpretation the Soviet may be upon the information available to them concerning Western and But in view of apparent Kremlin concern over any real or threat to Soviet of the over danger of capitalist attack on the Communist of expressed Soviet suspicion of various recent Western military and of various recent by Western public and of in the Western we believe that the Kremlin is probably dis turned over Western Authority I U E C In There cogent which probably lead the Kremlin to believe that a deliberate Western attack during is The West will still be far from that degree of mobilization which the Kremlin probably necessary for a successful attack on the Western on the continent will still be far from e f f e c t i v e offensive against the present military power of the and the growing military of the Even if the Kremlin did not anticipate an imminent attack by the it would pro able deliberately initiate general war if it came to the conclusion that an irreversible adverse shift in the balance of military power were that it could not otherwise be checked or and that it a grave threat to Soviet The Kremlin may estimate that already the balance of military power is shifting to its disadvantage because progressive in migration of the the increase in Western defense recent West mobilization and the prospect of German and and the increasing atomic of the we believe it unlikely that the Kremlin during conclude that the foregoing will necessarily result in a major shift in the balance of military The Kremlin probably foresee many in the implementation of a vigor united and lasting Western program for building military strength and corresponding for these It may estimate that sooner or later such a program will fail because of political and comic among and within the na of the free and meanwhile the Soviet firmly under Kremlin can continue to improve its relative power On balance we believe it unlikely that

PROBABLE SOVIET Of ACTION IT RESPECT To DURING THE PROBLEM To estimate Soviet with respect to and probable Soviet of action in pursuit of those during ESTIMATE Soviet In The Kremlin the aim of bring ing under its control the strategically import want area and of The Kremlin any substantial part of Ger many not under Soviet particularly if associated With the Western as a major obstacle to the realization of this mate aim and as a potential threat to its own The Kremlin will not consider as satisfactory any solution of the German pro does not promise to bring all of within the Soviet orbit as a step in its aim for world The Kremlin is undoubtedly aware that an majority of the German people is hostile to both Communism and the and that are not now favorable for gaining control of West through political also realize that the Western are deter to oppose by force any attempt to pose Soviet control on West by mile try the Kremlin must recognize that an attempt to Soviet control Political warfare as here used all manner of political and economic diplomatic in the Up and propaganda and front Communist Party and rolled trade union support of all revolutionary and psychological war over all of at this time would entail a decision to accept general the Kremlin is almost certainly currently with the following immediate To prevent the integration of West many with the West and to prevent the re armament of West To retain consolidate its hold on East While the expulsion of the Western from Berlin remains a basic Soviet the immediate objective in Berlin apparently is to weaken progressively the Western position in the Kremlin is West Berlin as an ave for illegal trade and as a point at which pressure can be Possible Political Towards The Achievement Of Its In The Kremlin is aware that the integration of West with the West German serious in here and it probably that armament will not achieve substantial in We that the Kremlin will continue to pursue its in West by political warfare at least the prospect for West German i Authority integration with the West and West German armament remain We believe that during the period of this the Kremlin will not give up or weaken its control over East to vent West integration with the or West German It is unlikely that in the Kremlin will surrender the great military and which the from its control over East in return for the establishment of an disarmed and united Ger many which it might hope subsequently to In order to delay West German in migration with the West and West German the Kremlin might attempt ne on free throughout Ger but only to gain The Kremlin almost certainly that free would result in a reputation of Communism in East the Kremlin would not be satisfied that a united which was not under Soviet control could be kept or that once would not eventually rear and turn against the We that the Kremlin is unlikely to permit free to take even if the Kremlin were convinced that by this it could block West German integration with the West and West German As a tactical the Kremlin might remove some of its more overt control include ing some of its military We do not that the Kremlin would so relax its control over East as to affect the of Soviet We that the Kremlin will seek to retain and consolidate its hold on East So long as East As in East Through in which the likelihood of withdrawal of Soviet occupational from East was also the Director of In to add the following the view of the Director of that the time in not family so short as to preclude the of a Soviet withdrawal from East such action were necessary to secure a and neutral German the will remain in a position to use East as a lever in with the West and to prevent German unify cation on unfavorable to the ultimate extension of Soviet control to all so long as Soviet occupy East the will retain a value able military base for either offensive or de offensive military against the West and for to On the other the Kremlin is not likely to feel that the complete and formal migration of East as a in the Soviet orbit would be an acceptable so of the German Such integral would be likely to the armament of West intensify in West and turn the pressure for man unity against the The Kremlin will almost certainly late the Berlin situation in an effort to under mine West German and West Berlin dance in the ability and determination of the Western to maintain their position in Berlin and in West To this it will probably continue its intermittent When the present program of rail and to by pass West Berlin is this year and Western retaliatory power thereby been this harassment may be in possibly even to the point of another complete ground On how we believe that a complete ground block ade will not be so long as the Kremlin to influence the course of in West since action of such a drastic nature would almost certainly pro due a storm of adverse West German public We do not believe that the Kremlin will attempt to seize West Berlin by force during except in the event of general Possibility Of Soviet Military To Achieve In West It is unlikely that the Kremlin that West German armament and Note Air Force comment on paragraph Authority i I em with the West will produce I ti during in the form of di o and military sufficient in to warrant deliberate resort to gen war or the grave risk of the Kremlin undoubtedly in West in the context of the general balance of The Kremlin will probably not feel itself with the choice between gen real war and at least the temporary abandon of its expansionism so long as it that actual or potential German strength is offset by the increasing strength of the Soviet bloc by political and economic in the There can be no that the Kremlin would regard the revival of German military and economic even in West as major barrier to the achievement of its immediate and ultimate It is further probable that the Kremlin would deliberately initiate general war if it came to the conclusion that West German in conjunction with the growing strength and unity of the were an irreversible adverse shift in the balance of military power which the Kremlin could not otherwise be checked or and a grave threat to Soviet We do not believe that the Kremlin will reach this conclusion in we continue to recognize the grave danger of a general war in result ing from a Kremlin action or series of not intended to have that or even from in the that but not the certainty

have been trained in the system These doubt include considerable since many probably belong to more than one Personnel who are not officially part of the above but who have had some appropriate military or medical must also be considered as part of the civil defense These include many people trained during World War The Soviet civil defense potential is much greater in both of trained

Communist invasion of would almost certainly against Western bases and shipping in the western and northern The probably estimate that an attempt to seize additional history in by the identifiable use

and become bet prepared to resist possible Western if necessary for the at tangent of Communist to apply military force against ing Author DISCUSSION COMMUNIST SOLIDARITY AND The Relationship Communist China and the present a united front to the We believe that for the period of this estimate the tending to divide the and Communist China will be far by close ideological and mutual involvement in the pursuit of common Current by their and their prop it that the are agreed at the present time upon the following once from To eliminate Western power and To prevent the resurgence of an armed To their military in and both offensive and To advance the world Communist move and in particular to divide and confuse and weaken their ability and determination to combat While these common

which this base can be supply rented by from the Bloc in is restricted by the capacity of the Railroad and the long sea Distribution and utilization of goods in the Communist Far East are further restricted by the limited transportation of must China and by the nature of the Soviet Far Eastern and Communist Despite the strain of the Communist production been and even somewhat With Soviet aid at current the economy of Communist China could support the Ko read war effort at current through the period of this We also believe that Communist with Soviet economic would be able to at least in its initial a war in the Far East which in addition to the Ko read Communist military opera elsewhere in Military c The Soviet Far Eastern ground represent about of the total Soviet ground These in the Far East are to be adequately and combat The Soviet Far Eastern Air sent approximately of the total combat air strength of the Soviet of this air force are currently Detailed of Communist In the

currently being and strength is being steadily We mate that approximately percent of the Soviet medium bomber strength is currently in the Soviet Far The Soviet Pacific Fleet the capability of supporting amphibious opera and mine and submarine warfare against shipping and in the Soviet military in the Far East will almost certainly be during the period of this estimate modernize of ground

for a time by local and sent from the western via the the restricted productive capacity of the Soviet Far East and the limited capacity of the Railroad would cause increasing if such extended longer than six to a These would arise if productive and rail were subjected to sustained air Although Communist large capability for expanding the field is limited by a severe shortage of equipment and by the high of the agrarian there will almost mainly be some improvement in the ground during the period of this estimate as a result of modernization of rear organization and and combat expert once in The Communist Army is the War best aside from that of the the most effective indigenous ground combat force in The combat of ground in the area is than that of the in China The Communist Army the capability of undertaking military opera elsewhere concurrently With Since the beginning of the the Communist Air Force in which is to be made up of North and Soviet been built to an impressive The jet fighter in the China area are to be progressively the of the in China and will remain during the period of this largely limited to the air de of North and North under of good and to limited against Up in and adjacent We believe the in China will continue to expand gradually ing the period of this estimate but will remain entirely dependent upon the for Sir craft and spare and tech and almost entirely depend upon the for and Unless some type of light jet bombardment aircraft is the of offensive of this air force will main extremely Deployment from the area would be necessary for air against and Southeast The of the Comma list Navy during the period of this estimate will remain It limited for coastal motor torpedo and amphibious The Communist are largely dependent upon the for heavy equip and The of these will therefore be reduced in those far removed from the relatively extensive network of par if transportation were subjected to effective due the power of the Communist We estimate that the will decline in strength during the period of this estimate unless they are given technical and logistical aid by the The growth of Communism in thus far been confined largely to the overseas a fact Its popular and must political warfare in land are very Communist for guerrilla warfare would be if the are successful in their to organize the population of the southern That in support of the In through their control of some key labor the in are capable of sabotage and this capability may increase somewhat during the period of this On the the development of Communist strength in will pro able depend largely upon in and An increase in must strength in those would al most certainly be reflected in where the government traditionally the dominant elsewhere in

Some aid and in probably received through Communist which is also actively en aged in among large The Communist Party the capability to harass the Government with sabotage and guerrilla especially in The disturbed situation resulting from the in of Dark and other rebel the for Communist sabotage and guerrilla we believe that the Communist Party will within the period of this develop the capability to seize The political warfare capable of the illegal Communist the membership of which is predominantly overseas rest largely upon the of Communist These by a much number of among the pop are likely to retain their current ability of the and disturbing the they are unlikely to gain widespread support or to threaten the position unless control is established in nearby or unless large outside support can otherwise be The Communist political are have consider in the since and are not to increase during the period of this es the armed Although Although the Comma list Party now only about mem

ported by the Bloc strategy of combining military to Japan with comic and political it is not likely that such will be able to Authority impair seriously with the and the party will lack the capable for seizing control of the government ing the period of this Subcontinent Communism does not now pose a major immediate threat to although the In Communist Party and allied re million in the The Communist Party still only about but it small vocal in state and the national The Communist Party in the national legislature will be able to do little more than to embarrass the government and to use their to spread Communist In those where Comma list strength is the party may be able to obtain representation in local coal and even seriously to dis rust parliamentary If the Communist Party its it probably will make additional in popular we believe that there is very little likelihood that the can lake sufficient progress seriously to contest the dominant position the Congress If the must Party should again emphasize the role of its popular support would probably diminish and the government would almost revive its repressive The Government with vigor and determination against the small and immature Communist Bloc political warfare in through the period of this estimate will almost certainly remain al though Soviet trade with and So political on may strengthen these The in may gain some popular support by domestic but will be unable to exert any sub the spatial influence upon policy or to seize control of the PROBABLE COMMUNIST Of ACTION General Affecting Communist Policy The probably that an attempt to seize additional territory in by the identifiable use of must or Soviet would station non Communist particularly in and might create grave danger of war against of general war in the Far or even of global The Comma probably also estimate that the comic and of must China and the Soviet Far East make the outcome of a general war in the Far East at best the are probably confident that fur progress can be made towards the achievement of their by political We that during the period of this estimate the refrain from new of action the identifiable use of Communist or Soviet From the late the in directed their chiefly toward the instigation and support of open by within non Communist These to offer of success cause of the and the prestige and the strategic en by Communism as a consequence of Communist military in and the back of firm and cohesive leadership in the of How since the risk of Western regalia against this type of action greatly and at the same time some non Communist in the area have become in We believe that during the period of this estimate the will not intensify their to overthrow by the open rebellion of indigenous such have been reduced in effect likeness or stalemate and the overthrow of through these would now require Communist or Soviet intervention of such magnitude as entail the possibility of war against general war in or even of global We believe that Communist China and the will attempt to maintain the already in the such as the the North the Communist in and the More they will undoubtedly continue some guerrilla activity in other of Southeast I At the same they will make organizational and psychological for intensification of the at a later and will work toward strengthening local must military and paramilitary Throughout the period of this estimate the will give a high priority to strengthening their organization in non Communist with the and Their tactics will vary from count try to country but will be designed to attract particular varied ethnic and religious minor into front Na and local Communist also increase their to form Bloc diplomacy and Bloc prop panda will support these political warfare within each In we believe that the Bloc will increase its use f economic to influence the and We believe that the will not significantly increase their power and in during the period

resumption of an indefinite military or the conclusion of an armistice The have the capability for a major ground air attack with little or no but we believe that they probably will not take the initiative to launch such an attack during the of this We believe that the Comma will protect the so long as they consider that they con gain political and military van from the situation in and so long as they estimate that a continuation of the war does not involve grave risk of If an armistice is during the period of this we believe that the negotiation of a political settlement will be complicated by Communist injection of Far Eastern unrelated to Whether or not a political settlement is we that the Communist active to gain control of all will main The almost mainly will not attempt

MILITARY Introductory The imposition of a total embargo by the entire world would presumably extend to both trade and The implementation of such an embargo would presumably include to prevent the transfer or charter of shipping for the Communist China the denial of service and repair in of bound for and from Communist and the goods directly or indirectly to Communist China from other in the Soviet The following would prevent effective enforcement of a complete tension of trade and shipping against the Soviet Bloc and Communist Even should the Up recommend a full embargo on trade with Communist it probable that various Middle Eastern na would because of their and the economic importance of with EFFECTS Effect on The impact on of total embargo would depend on the extent to the Soviet Bloc was able and willing make up for the loss of Western shipping that now char by the now serving the China and the specific by the the In view of data on Communist foreign trade and on the Soviet it is impossible to estimate with precision the impact of a total embargo Communist The following projection is based on the level of trade during Assuming a continuation of present It is that the total value of Communist legitimate from the world in will remain at the As with are ex to include a higher proportion of heavy bulk particularly chemical As a result of these in the volume of Communist legitimate from the world in is at as with in t t Although transshipment might be con rolled to a limited extent by quant native on goods from the West to Eastern and the effect time prevention of transshipment would be impossible so long as trade applied against these are less rigid than those applied against Communist S transshipment could only be stopped completely and Communist China all to Increase entire Bloc were from to or the level for the China carter Raw cotton are to decline value from million to million and volume from to World are lower and production Communist China As several are not now with the limited embargo declared by the and most Western na are now strongly opposed to further of fertilizer are to Increase by percent In volume and value view of Communist to Increase pro auction of Industrial Authority to the West from Communist China are to be the same as in or million valued at It is unlikely that the present rate of smuggling could be significantly inasmuch as a complete embargo would necessarily involve a general strengthening of Clandestine would tend consist of of small bulk and high as and motor vehicle but the total volume may be assumed to be about the level for under the assumption of On the basis of the above the theoretical annual loss to Communist China as a result a complete embargo would be of valued at million and earnings from million of valued at The Soviet Bloc could assume the entire burden by an embargo and supply to of it otherwise Would received from the Such are available in the Bloc and transport would not impose an absolute limit on their the degree to which the Soviet Bloc would compensate for the loss of from the West would depend in general on the Soviet appraisal of the relative of these in Communist China as to them elsewhere in the Soviet the The Soviet Union a strong interest in Communist strength and for this reason would probably assign a high priority to those Communist import that have a significant effect on Communist military Much lower would be to the Communist China formerly the degree that the burden thus on the rest of the Soviet Orbit would be relatively On the basis of these See paragraph it is roughly that the Bloc would supply virtually all the iron and ma and and most of the heavy industrial and and only part of the crude chemical and The Soviet would probably not compensate of the and some We up the lost through imposition of an the Soviet Bloc would crease its annual to Communist China by about toll valued at reducing the net import loss to about If these additional from the Bloc were carried by total from the Bloc in Bloc vessel would amount to approximately in on and other to engaged in trade with Communist China reduce the opacity of the Soviet Bloc merchant It would require the Soviet Bloc to fuel from at sea and require the Bloc to transport additional fuel to the Far either over the orb Bloc are presently carrying essential e An embargo would also result in in crease in value of Communist to the Soviet Bloc but a decrease in the of its total Because of the transport involved and the nature of the it is probable that it would not be for the Comma to divert to the Soviet Bloc a large part of the million of Communist China now to the Communist China The Soviet Bloc the ship capacity to carry the total to Communist China charting under these the would have to use some In thus their seizure by the In add the Soviet Bloc would have io find alternate time and more costly for carrying on trade with the Authority to increase its production of strategic with which to pay for its from the Soviet and other from Communist China could be so that there would be little or no net effect on Communist debtor position in the On the basis of the above highly special time an embargo would reduce the volume of Communist total in by and the value by This would represent a reduction of approximately percent in the value of must total and perhaps as much as percent of It is that imposition of a complete embargo on Western would not effect a major reduction in the present total volume of Communist total would be reduced by or by more Plan The proportionate reduction in the volume of ex would be A total embargo om trade with Communist would affect the low of purely military and all of which for limited brought in by now come from the Soviet Military would almost certainly determine the relative of compensating from the Soviet Bloc goods related to military would probably be least affected by a complete Economic The Comma list economy already made considerable progress in to available of western The main effect on the Communist economy of a plate embargo would to force more rapid adjustment to a pattern already being Although the reduction in resulting from embargo probably would regard the nose Communist principally with to in the product of these in out put would in part be offset by the availability for domestic consumption of some that formerly were to the The loss of foreign flag shipping for coastal would reduce shipping nose Communist which now the bulk of this rail could absorb by and production of some goods re used and virtually the government would be con fronted with a sizable loss would be minor in relation the total and to total Chi nose Communist budgetary Military A embargo would probably have no effect the of the to sustain military in and very limited effects on their to under take military Internal Political A total em cargo would not appreciable affect the in eternal political strength of the must Burden on the Rest of the A total embargo would not seriously increase the comic burden China gently on the rest of the Soviet the rest of the to an even greater extent would be ex to Communist China many that the Soviet Bloc normally for its own There would also be some from a trade deficit and an increase in transportation but they would not assume serious EFFECTS The adverse economic effects of a complete embargo on Communist China would probably decrease rather than Director Naval Intelligence to point out that a considerable portion of Communist shipping would have to be North China to supply the South China coastal Such diversion would re due the shipping available the industrial North for the of coal and POL and Authority increase with the passage of The loss of cotton and other raw would be made up in large part through the of domestic production or of finally produced must for the continued expansion of heavy industry would not be appreciable since such now are depend almost wholly on of capital goods from the Soviet Bloc and on tic production of capital greater emphasis probably would be on the expansion of rail links with the Soviet Union at some expense to other of the development in view of current of the of growth of the gross national of the and the ability of the Soviet Bloc to provide capital goods and to bear the of providing such goods will increase significantly over the next Effect on A total embargo would tend to increase the possible of Should the So Union be Unwilling to continue to supply Communist essential the adverse of the embargo on would be Even under the level Of ex to might feel that their should be given higher On other Communist complete military and economic dependence on the Soviet Bloc would result in a progressive integration of must economic and military plan with Bloc and and thus tend to reduce communist to disagree with the PROBABLE EFFECT Of A BLOCKADE Of COMMUNIST POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AND MILITARY The capacity and efficiency of the Communist railway system have apparently to the point where it could handle Port and any additional burden which might be by a total The Effect on Communist tension of Communist railway Whereas an embargo would operate only against and and the possible load under a naval blockade would interact of embargo would require and Bloc as equipment and This would place thus Communist some on the Soviet whether it to those which could be brought overland from to supply the necessary the Soviet and freight or to restore for rolling stock must China could obtain some essential and steel and to expand the production Western overland the On of freight and in the basis of our tentative projection of it is probable that the Soviet Bloc must under present con would be able to supply minimum a naval blockade would cut Communist without serious of from list both legitimate and in other of the Soviet plus from Bloc or a total of million Military Over a longer a valued at the block total embargo would not reduce present nose Communist military but it ade would stop Communist might hinder an expansion of those in to

possibility dis cursed In Paragraph achievement of the effect here would only depend on the of the Up and other blocking to an open Authority about million of which million were to count and million to the Soviet A naval blockade would presumably operate against Communist coastal Although a blockade would not be effective against local inshore coastal ship it would virtually eliminate Communist coastal traffic which is to be of cargo per day or million per The most import want of this traffic are the move of and goods between North and the movement of soybean cake from to South and the exchange trade of for between Sang and South A naval blockade would cut off Communist total which amount to million per The amount by which Communist total would be reduced thereby would de end primarily on the extent to which the Soviet Bloc its present level of to Communist the amount by which total were reduced would depend on the of the railway and of Communist inland transportation Soviet Bloc to Communist Although the Soviet Bloc would probably pro video Communist essential import re the Bloc probably would not re place all of Communist lost because of a Of the import tonnage of million about of such as and ma while consist of common which can now be from It is roughly that the Soviet Bloc would continue to supply all of the but only about of the other or a total about Of the non the Soviet Bloc would re place in part Communist of industrial and but would replace little or none of the of raw ammonium sup and funny On this the total of Communist over the railway primarily from the East would probably be on the order of opinion per year present million China would pro able be able increase its to the Soviet Bloc to avoid any significant increase In its deficit with the Capacity of the Overland Communist China in to total per the bulk of which came eastward over the We believe that the the capacity to carry total year or per plus the minimum needs of the

Soviet a reduction in the peacetime volume of moving to the Soviet Far movement of freight by sea to to be to Capacity Communist Inland Transportation The additional burden by a blockade would add approximately percent to the total volume of freight currently carried by the of Communist It is that cause of the long average haul the transportation overland of the freight cut off by a blockade would require about io percent of the freight car park and about percent of the locomotive We believe the Communist the to carry this but it should be noted that some of China by coastal shipping are not by rail Since the additional burden of essential tonnage on both the Railroad and the internal transportation of Communist China could probably be carried with we believe that the reliance on overland transportation family would not limit the extent to which must essential could be it should be pointed out that it would be possible for the to ship goods to China by sea to Valid boston and thence by rail to Economic A naval blockade would have a greater effect on the Communist economy than would an The economic growth would be semi only additional would be on internal and further gains from trade and further budgetary rev would be In those which are now by coastal shipping and which not by rail particularly South a reversion to more primitive of transport would The reduce in of

on Soviet The Kremlin probably would prefer to move toward the attainment of its by short of general While the Communist session in an inherent risk of general the Kremlin sought to limit its own role in the and not to use the war as an excuse for The Kremlin of general war over the issue and for this reason would probably prefer either a continuation of the present situation or an armistice to a spread in that in view would lead to general Internal in Communist China and North Communist During the Communist political have been Forced collection of funds been in order to finance the war and

China and the strengthening of political and economic have the re at the disposal of the We I therefore believe it unlikely that domestic either economic or are the Communist regime under any immediate and demanding pressure to an armistice in So long as the to furnish a large share of the military equipment and for the war and economic the Communist war at current or even somewhat

among civilian population continued to decline and there is some evidence of nationalism within the there is no dance that resolution of the North or the morale of the North armed been substantially

North regime will continue to be to the global or regional of the in Although there is evidence of a recent in crease in Communist influence in North we believe that the still North The of primary

prevent a large extension of electromagnetic We that under cold war the Bloc could allocate the necessary and technical competence for a large expansion of its present electro magnetic against Western station and broadcast reception outside the without thereby significantly essential Bloc Un of general the essential would be significantly and in some markedly We are unable to make a specific quantitative allowance for this but believe that under of gen real war the Bloc would retain a substantial part of its present capability for expanded electromagnetic We estimate that the Bloc the

Appendix of Technical notice warfare since there is a wide latitude of interchangeability in Since World War In the Bloc made good all war in and space with expansion of and improvement of The radio

been Bloc production of radio equipment above that some such are already in While these have only range and require re lay for longer distance they are essentially On the evidence of recent of and our of Bloc industrial and we believe that the Bloc system and Bloc output of electronic and other related equipment will continue to ex and rapidly during the period of this For the output of electron is to increase over percent during the next two Further expand son is also in the production of radio equipment above in the extension of in wire and coaxial line construct and in the of some wire We believe that the supply of trained per sonnet in the Bloc will be adequate to support the rate of expansion of the In though not of For further of the expansion and of probable see Appendix of Economic Authority Bloc competence to be as advanced as that of the Present Bloc as noted sufficiently in excess of essential communication require to leave a substantial fraction of radio free for actual or potential electro magnetic warfare The ex mansion of the Bloc and Bloc production of equipment will probably increase this The Bloc could increase its at the expense of only a small fraction of the re to the or electronics expansion For ex the building of a thousand capable of both internal and external would absorb electronic equipment to the amount of about percent of the value of the pro auction of such Use of these thousand as could more than double the present production of electronic equip for either or would be at the expense of production for important other such as navigation military fire control and con tool But the fact that the Bloc already built up its and in excess of likely peace time or cold war that the strengthening of Bloc in tele with a correlation increase in electromagnetic warfare is re garden by the Kremlin as an important part of its preparation for possible VULNERABILITY Of THE To RETALIATORY ELECTROMAGNETIC WARFARE The strategic of possible retaliatory electromagnetic warfare on the Bloc would be limited by the extent to which the Bloc could resort to alternative of In communication immune to such the extensive alternative are and fur expansion is under the Bloc is still dependent on radio susceptible for essential communication in and must China and throughout the Bloc in respect to mobile operational and navigation to Disruption of Bloc radio medication could impair the efficient the operation of government readiness of its armed and the per of the Bloc It could also necessitate a diversion of scarce for the accelerated expansion of substitute Bloc for air and naval action and for of military could be by electromagnetic PROBABLE Of ACTION Basic Under cold war the primary objective in regard to notice warfare will almost certainly continue to be that of the penetration of Western propaganda blamed at Bloc Concomitantly it will also almost certainly seek further expansion of Bloc for a possible extension of electromagnetic warfare to other of Western and further reduction of the vulnerability to electromagnetic warfare There is little conflict among these object The continued expansion of both long range radio and alternative the development of and the training of personnel serve all three basic and the real time emphasis put on the several could rapidly be without serious economic or other The extent to which the Up and its allies now possess or may develop the capability of exploit ing the vulnerability to electromagnetic warfare is beyond the scope of this In the event of general the Kremlin would almost certainly seek to achieve mum disruption of Western military Authority E G and navigation At the same the Kremlin would continue to seek to insulated its from Western radio con Bloc of Action Under Cold War In its cold war the Bloc will almost certainly not employ its full for electromagnetic The Kremlin will be restrained in the exercise of those by its desire to avoid any substantial impairment of its own till either by interference or by diversion of to notice or the diversion of greatly of and man power from other in order to increase the capacity and reduce the vulnerability of the Bloc The lin will accordingly seek to avoid Bloc electromagnetic warfare and by premature in order to serve the advantage of surprise and to accelerated development of West defensive and offensive in the field of electromagnetic A further consideration which may restrain the Bloc from systematic interference with Western and navigation is that such clearly illegal would worsen the diplomatic The restrain ing effect of this consideration would depend on the general policy in regard to or between the Bloc and the The Kremlin will almost certainly con to concentrate its electromagnetic war fare primarily on the penetration of Western propaganda broad blamed at Bloc This mary objective can be by three of preventive internal as at of Western blamed at the reducing the availability to Bloc of those of radio capable of Western and and on Bloc We believe the Kremlin will con to use all three of these of Primary reliance will almost certainly con to rest on It is also probable that further will be made to restrict the number of radio in the Bloc capable of Western but mass con fiction of such is The Bloc will also continue to seek to lede the expansion of Western for beating propaganda at Bloc pop Under cold war it will employ only propaganda and diplomatic primarily at nearby Western count where actual or Western broad casting are The relative emphasis upon as against conciliatory will reflect the general policy in regard to or ten between the Bloc and the The Bloc will probably continue deliberate interference with Western directed to German and We be that it will probably not extend this interference on a large scale to Western broadcast reception outside and since the Kremlin almost certainly that such extension of notice warfare would worsen the position without according compensate ing advantage to the The Bloc will almost certainly and may its use of radio such as for the dissemination of or prop possibly to the extent of occasional use of Western for such The principal limiting factor on this activity would probably be the risk of political back fire in the event of actual exposure of such or of too frequent and obvious The Bloc will almost certainly not resort to electromagnetic propaganda is propaganda deliberately as to a broadcast pur to originate in but actually from a Bloc propaganda is prop panda with the source a broad cast in from a Bloc station with no idea notification so that might infer that it in Authority wholesale interference with Western comma Interference and navigation with Western navigation may occasion ally be used to create of actual or trespass of Bloc territory by Western Such could be as in the to sow dimension among the Western by fostering an impression of Up recklessness or aggressive The Bloc will continue to expand its long range radio transmission system and the out put and capacity of its electronic equipment It will continue to promote the de development of and for during its essential military and civilian less susceptible to interference either from Bloc or from outside Bloc of Action Under of General War In the event of general war the principal on the exercise of its electromagnetic warfare would The Bloc would attempt to dis rust Western military and other essential and navigation and in this effort would not only employ and but probably would also undertake military and sabotage action against Western and navigate aid At the same time the Bloc would probably intensify its effort to prevent reception of Western program in In addition to of such the it would also almost certainly adopt more drastic direct police action against and probably the mass confiscation of some of radio

ultimate Kremlin objective with respect to which is to bring the entire count try under Soviet The Kremlin must that it is not in a position to advance directly toward this ultimate active by political action because of the utility of the overwhelming majority of Ger to It must also recon size that an attempt to impose Communist control over all by force would re suit in general believe that through the period of this estimate the Kremlin will seek by political warfare to prevent or at least to regard the Western program for West German rear and the integration of West with the The Soviet will pro able continue to believe that there is a good chance of charting the Western program through a political warfare campaign which upon Western fear of Ger man armament and upon German desire i for Even if the is and West German armament the lin will probably believe that the implement station of the and the rear ing of West will proceed and that there will continue to be opportunity to thwart the Western In any it is unlikely that by the armament of West will have ad to a point at which the Soviet would regard West as a serious mile try The Kremlin in its political warfare against West will seek to encourage and neutrality by military might and determine the at the same time it will use tactics to counter armament sent Soviet propaganda will appeal to Ger man

make for the establishment of a and on the basis of free and the withdrawal of all occupation from we believe that such would contain which the Kremlin would intend to be unacceptable to the or that

German integration with the West or West German So long as it East the Kremlin will remain in a position to use East as a lever in with the West and to prevent German unification on notable to the ultimate extension of Soviet control to all so long as Soviet occupy East the will retain a valuable base for either offensive or defensive military and for to intimidate the East great economic and

eventually rear and turn against the We that the Kremlin will retain consolidate its hold on East Ger many and will seek to increase East German economic and military The Soviet program will be tantamount to making East into a Satellite with security as and isolation of the population almost as complete as in the other Satellite the Kremlin probably that the formal integration of East into the Soviet Bloc as a would be likely to ten the armament of West and its integration with the West and to turn the pressure for German unity against the the Kremlin will probably continue to make to the needs of the prop panda campaign for unity by a facade in East Ger many and by some to maintain tenuous with West On the other if the Soviet tactics are and the are the Kremlin may conclude a separate peace treaty and an alliance with East and incorporate it into the Bloc as a The Kremlin probably that the maintenance of Soviet control in East Ger many is dependent upon the presence of Soviet in East the lin may estimate that it could greatly in crease the effectiveness of its political warfare campaign by removing some of its overt con tool from East include ing some of its

in for a satisfactory settlement of the German It is even conceivable that at some stage the Soviet might withdraw all Soviet from East if they were con that such a step would lead to the withdrawal of all Up from and would create favorable to the position of Soviet control over all of This is only a remote at least for the period of this but we believe it cannot be Despite the recent listening

analyze the principal affecting Soviet Bloc and to estimate the probable development of those through THE PROBLEM That there will not be general war within period of this ASSUMPTION within the result ing from the change in leadership may ultimately affect Soviet Bloc but so far the and military bases of Soviet power are not to have been affected by This is based on the within the Soviet Bloc since and does not attempt to estimate or to what these may be by within the ruling The Special Department of the Assistant Chief of Department of the the Deputy Director for The Joint believe that this sentence should be with the It impossible as yet to estimate with dance whether or not a struggle for power among the new will develop ing the period We that if such a struggle for power should it would be confined to the higher echelon of the Soviet Communist and Government and would probably not precipitate open conflict within or between the armed and security or involve the Soviet We es that the of the regime in the is unlikely to be by that may develop among the Soviet The rate of growth of the Soviet my will almost certainly remain higher than that of the Up or any other major Western the output of the will remain much lower than that of the and the output of the en tire Bloc will remain much lower than that of the Bloc scientific and technical capable will continue to increase throughout the period of this the scientific assets number and quality of trained equip and financial of the Up will remain greater than those of the and the assets of the West as a whole will remain far greater than those of the By the may have a stockpile of from to atomic We have no evidence that thermonuclear are being by the The beyond are tentative of the for the v Authority Soviet and even field testing of thermonuclear based on the of Such may take place by How it is very unlikely that the could test a full scale thermonuclear de vice based on these before There is also a possibility that Soviet field based on independent re search and development along other and advanced to the thereon clear problem might occur by Testing of advanced might be possible if Up develop were known through espionage or other The now the capability semi only to disrupt Western radio and navigation Soviet in related indicate that the is now capable of equipment for up through and the could produce such equip by If such equipment were produced on a large scale and in operational it would probably con statute a threat to Western radio to a lesser un less Western were We estimate that the size of Bloc will not increase sub spatially by The emphasis in the program for increasing Bloc military strength will continue to be upon the armed and upon enlarging the atomic For more detailed see Bloc and Probable of Action in Electromagnetic We estimate that the Bloc now the capability to concurrent in continental Eu the Middle and The Bloc could reinforce with Chi nose Communist and Soviet the Communist now in and at the same time an invasion of Japan by Soviet The now the capability to concurrent air against the the continental Eu the Middle and the off shore island chain of against the Up would be much more difficult than those against the other The the to reach all of the Up and to attempt the delivery of its full stockpile of atomic even a could reach only the extreme northwestern cover on without aerial Even with aerial refueling and other range ex tension attack upon the stra topic northeastern industrial area and upon most of the principal strategic bases almost certainly would involve the ex expenditure of the aircraft and most of the on Until it a heavy bomber available for operational the will not have the capability to reach most of the stra typically important in the Up on A heavy bomber based upon a type which been seen in flight No estimate of the success of these can be made without considering the effects of the of opposing We believe that the the capability to utilize range extension but we have no evidence that any of these have been Authority i I I may be in production and may be avail able for operational use within the period of this We estimate that the Bloc the ca ability of providing vigorous opposition against air on critical in the interior of the under cond of good Under clear moonlight night Bloc defense are fair against piston bomb ers and negligible against jet Under of poor day or Bloc interception are Currently known point to an increase of Bloc air defense during the period of this How it is impossible to estimate the ex tent of significance of any be cause the future development of intercept equipment and of is in any such an estimate would require knowledge of the of aircraft through the period of this Bloc naval for ocean going and new and For more detailed see for on the Up through March The Director of Naval Intelligence that this paragraph should read as We believe the Bloc will continue its present emphasis on air and that its in this respect will increase during the period of this Operational use of early warning and ground intercept and the extensive employment of intercept equipment will contribute to this The development and production of jet and which are within Bloc would further improve Bloc air we cannot estimate the sig of these relative to fu true air offensive as now are de to protect Bloc coastal and award of ground We believe as new construction with opera emphasis will be laid on the area of striking which could ate within the of the range of air Bloc capability is and in the event of could seriously interfere with Allied sea in and the Far or with Western naval in adjacent to the The Soviet submarine force will increase its capability to undertake offensive pa and mining along most of the strategically vital sea and if the specialized craft have been simultaneously to launch missile on both the Atlantic and Pacific seaboard of the The Soviet Navy will have no amphibious with in the period of this but it will remain capable of mounting amphibious in considerable The principal of strength upon which Bloc political warfare are based will remain Bloc mile try which fear and and the strategic economic power and and Other of Bloc political warfare strength are the highly organized Communist and the leadership and discipline of the individual Communist We believe the capable of sub to this but we have no evidence to indicate that such have been Authority E R E In I I I Communist and which influence many as well as and the accuse later experience and professional skill of Soviet and sub version and of Soviet use of front the fixing of Communist purpose to impose Comma on the world and the unified direct of Communist action give the a tactical political warfare advantage in the di and intensity of of action to be used against the It is difficult to estimate how Bloc political warfare will since they depend to a large degree not only upon the situation within the but also upon the success with which the world the chal to its stability which would exist even if there were no Communist It is also difficult to estimate the develop of Bloc political warfare because they are dependent not only on the relative attractive power of Comma list and but on the relative military strength of the Bloc and the If Western military strength should relative to that of the Bloc political warfare would probably On the other fear of war and consequent vulnerability to Bloc political warfare would probably increase must if the capability to deliver atomic should increase relative to Western and if the Bloc should improve its air real time to Western offensive We believe that during the period of this estimate Communist to establish Communist by po political warfare will be most likely to increase in Southeast and the Middle These will probably remain in and In other of the Comma list to influence the of and plus will constitute the principal danger by Bloc political The may be able to undermine support for Western of defense and for political and economic and they may be able to height among the of the West For these they can exploit national between the Western economic and trade nationalism in colonial and dependent and dread of The Director of Naval Intelligence this paragraph should read as in order to render the military hypothesis more realistic and It is to estimate how Bloc political warfare will since they de end to a large degree upon the situation within the the success with which the non Communist world the to its stability which would exist even if there were no Communist and the relative military of the Bloc and the Bloc political warfare will increase if the world to solve adequately the of economic national common and for independence in the colonial If Western military strength and cohesion should increase substantially relative to that of the Bloc po political warfare would probably be and might decline in some On the other if the military strength of the Bloc should substantially increase relative to that of the Bloc political warfare would particularly with respect to the promotion of and the fear of Authority DISCUSSION I AFFECTING Internal Political the resulting from the change in leadership ultimately affect Soviet Bloc but so far the economic and military bases of Soviet power are not to have been affected by This is based the within the Soviet Bloc since and does not attempt to estimate or to what these may be affected by within the ruling Conflict within the ruling group would be the internal development most likely to jeopardize Soviet stability during the period of this The dissatisfaction latent among large of the Soviet over low living and over the severity of police will remain but will not constitute a threat to the stability of the new The of and indoctrination and the cam pain to instill hostility toward the West have almost certainly reduced but not the reservoir of popular good will toward the During the period of this the regime will almost certainly be able to reduce further the effect of external propaganda on the general population of the The Special Department of the Assistant Chief of and the Deputy Director for The Joint believe that this sentence should be re with the It is impossible as yet to estimate with dance or not a struggle for power among the new will develop ing the period We that such a struggle for power should it would be confined to the higher echelon of the Soviet Communist Party and Government and would probably not precipitate open or between the armed and security or involve the Soviet We es that the stability of the regime in the is unlikely to be by that may develop among the Soviet and to continue rigorous on access to Western A major reorganization of Soviet true at least weaken Soviet Before there were that the Soviet regime attempt a major reorganization of through an attack upon the kolkhoz market and the private sector of While we believe it unlikely that the new Soviet will adopt this there is not sufficient evidence to make this estimate with Such a move would ensure more complete control of culture and would satisfy the doctrinaire it would almost mainly evoke peasant resistance and visor anime the food at least Special Department of State and the Assistant Chief of believe this sentence should be with the following We believe improbable that any internal po political a possible struggle for power among Soviet will jeopardize the stability of the Soviet regime during the period of this As long as the Soviet are able to resolve their or to keep incident from spreading to the armed and security pollen the system of over the population will al most certainly prevent any group or faction in the from posing a serious threat to the Soviet The Special Department of State and the Assistant Chief of believe this paragraph should be Al though in that the Soviet regime was to at some unspecified that would re due or eliminate that kolkhoz market and the private economy of collective he also stated that such could become effective only gradually and over a long period of The new leadership is certainly aware that a drastic change would probably antagonist the and reiterated the need for caution making any in the cultural sector of the Soviet The Special Depart of and the Assistant Chief of believe the following paragraph should be substituted for paragraph The new Soviet leadership will almost certain ly pursue the basic domestic established during recent In will con to maintain a fundamentally hostile anti toward the West and to emphasize the increase of Bloc military power and the expand son of the Bloc industrial It is also un likely that the new leadership will institute any radical in Soviet agriculture during the period of this Authority The Communist China Soviet control over the is ally complete and is unlikely to diminish or to be successfully from within l during the period of this If a struggle for power should break out within the Soviet ruling group and if it were con within the higher echelon of the Soviet Communist Party and Soviet control over the would not be sig affected if the strut within the Party should spread to the Soviet Army and the Soviet Security and should lead to open conflict within or between these Soviet control over the would be In the unlikely event that the new Soviet should adopt a policy of rapid col of agriculture in the peasant resistance would increase and cultural production in the would decline for some even rapid I collectivization of agriculture in the would probably not seriously shake There will continue to be of the various Satellite Communist but the are unlikely to weaken the reliability of these or their control over the Satellite The will almost certainly not be able by completely to isolate the population of the from Western and the passive utility now general among the Satellite plus will persist and perhaps In tensile Communist indoctrination of selected of the the and favored treatment of some will almost certainly increase the number of of the Soviet u The Special Department of and the Assistant Chief of believe that this sentence should Even if a struggle for power should break out within the Soviet ruling the struggle would probably be carried on within the higher echelon of the Soviet Communist Party and Government and would not significantly affect Soviet control over the The Communist regime firm control over and there is little likelihood of its control being threat end or shaken by domestic within the period of this unless Communist China should suffer a serious military defeat or unless conflict should within the Communist Party over the relation ship between and Communist China accepted leadership in the international Communist but to be more an ally than a and Keeping sent a united front to the world and are apparently agreed upon the following To eliminate Western power and influx once from To increase their military potential in To prevent the resurgence of an armed and To advance the world Communist move in to divide the must and to weaken their ability and determination to combat The military dependence of Communist China upon the will almost certainly at least until

depend once of Communist China upon the might be may be strained by to of Soviet economic by the extent of Soviet military commit to Communist by disagreement over the control of border and by the definition of role in the Communist we believe that the new Soviet leadership will deal can with Mao and that a split between I I I I I I I In In I Authority Keeping and is unlikely during the period of this unless the stability of Soviet regime should be weak Economic The gross national product of the Bloc been increasing rapidly during the post war Calculation of its magnitude and with prewar are family subject to considerable We that the level of for the Bloc as a whole had been by We estimate further that by Bloc gross national product was about one third greater than in thus increasing on the average about percent per The rate of growth of the Soviet economy will almost certainly remain higher than the rate which the Up or any other major West state will unless there is a drastic orientation of Soviet economic We estimate that the Soviet average rate of growth during the period from to will be to percent annually and that Soviet gross national product will increase to Despite Soviet during the postwar the output of the will remain much lower than that of the and the output of the entire Bloc will remain much lower than that of the We estimate that the Soviet gross national production was about to one third that of the Up in and that the gross national product of the entire Bloc was about that of the These in ratio will probe by be reduced slightly during the period of this although the in will be solute Bloc output in the basic of Bloc economic are based largely upon postwar comic and recent in the the and Communist The do not consider or to what ex these or may be affected by within the ruling group of the or by outside the and will re main substantially below that of the in of total output of all of goods and are somewhat misleading as of real time capacity to produce military equipment in Since the end of World War the a much pro portion of its gross national product to mile try than any Western estimate that about of the Soviet gross national product is now devoted to military and that the proportion will remain at least as high through the period of this The Bloc during the period of this mate will almost certainly continue to con centrale upon expanding its industrial Total Soviet industrial production will pro able expand by about to So production of consumer goods will increase only about to Satellite industry as a whole will probably though not so rapidly as that of the Although industrial output in Communist China will probably also it will con to be a small part of the Bloc Production of consumer goods in the and in Communist China will probably expand more slowly than in the Present per food consumption in the of is nearly equal to the Agricultural output in the will probably increase between and percent during the period of this The gain will be in the average diet will probably improve somewhat during the period of this Despite the growth of new of in dusty in the the older industrial re the will still provide the bulk of Soviet industrial to disperse Soviet industry and to create regional will but the production of many basic and of most equipment will remain geographically Authority The Soviet program is de to maintain vital of the my under wartime or emergency and to facilitate the conversion of industry to a wartime We are unable to mate the magnitude and composition of the Soviet but we believe in total production through will support a considerably enlarged strategic already begun in some and we believe that during the period will be adopted through out the By the Bloc economy will have a higher level of than at although certain will remain of substantial importance to Bloc industrial and military These include electronic tube certain certain of machinery and equipment with their spare and probably also natural and If these of port should cease to be bottleneck would appear in the Bloc productive and for a limited period of time adverse refer would spread through the We believe that Bloc for ex port to the world will in crease somewhat during period of this We estimate that by the Bloc will be capable of capital equip and of mate to the Scientific and Technical Soviet scientific and technical have rapidly since World War and we believe that they will continue to in crease throughout the period of this given science and technology a high priority and given great emphasis to increasing the contribution of science and For more detailed discussion of this see Economic Effects of a of These of in Bloc once and technology are based on the assume that scientific and technical will not be significantly affected by political technology to Bloc military with most evident in air defense and in the development and production of atomic The scientific assets of the Up ber and quality of trained family and financial are greater than those of the and the assets of the West as a whole are far greater than those of the the is ex pending great effort to reduce this and it will probably continue to devote a higher proportion of its scientific and tech assets to military than the the difference between Soviet and Up scientific in this period may not be so significant as the superiority of the Up in scientific assets would Soviet higher education in most scientific and technical is roughly comparable to that of the but a shortage of scientific and technical personnel will continue throughout the period of this We estimate that there are slightly over one mil lion Soviet who have received scion topic or technical from and the Up About are people are engaged in scion topic research and in teaching science in the to about similarly engaged in the We estimate that during the period of this estimate at least as many people will graduate in engineering and the physical in the as in the Soviet science and technology are subject to the same type of and control as all other Soviet Even though Soviet are a privileged their research is subject to many of the usual totalitarian Such will probably have a more weakening effect upon theoretical research than upon practical within the period of this While numerous in and biology have been at there is no evidence that ideological hamper directly meeting military East and and to lesser extent other Satellite a Authority possess scientific and technical and which provide a significant since to the total at the disposal of the On the other because of the extreme shortage of scientific and technical and family is unlikely to contribute to Bloc Scientific and Technical in Particular Since World War the made substantial in atomic aircraft design and and Soviet science will continue to contribute substantially to the increase of Bloc military strength and throughout the period of this par in the following Atomic and Thermonuclear The Soviet atomic energy program will con to have one of the highest in the allocation of Bloc Soviet ca for atomic research will remain considerably less than those of the Up in both personnel and We believe that the Soviet atomic energy program will con to concentrate almost entirely upon the development and production of We have no that thermonuclear are being

Soviet and even field testing of thermonuclear based on the of Such take place by it is very un likely that the could test a full scale thermonuclear device based on these dis before There is also a ability that Soviet field based on index pendant research and development along other and advanced to the there nuclear problem might occur by Testing of advanced might be if Up were possible known through espionage or other compare See paragraph for the size of the Soviet atomic Soviet aircraft and will continue to develop and produce aircraft of high performance By the end of most Soviet combat aircraft will be gas turbine Fighter aircraft superior to the So jet the may already have been and may be in serial product in An jet interceptor may also have been and such an interceptor may be in operational use before Within the period of this the may complete development and begin serial production of a jet medium A heavy bomber based upon a type which been seen in flight may be in production and may be available for operational use within the period of this The made sub spatial progress in expanding its electronics industry and in Western It is now and into opera electronic equipment of The Soviet electronics industry is now capable of independent research and development and the technical capability to produce electronic We believe that by the will have and put into

Political warfare an extremely role for who consider military warfare only an extension of political warfare in their persistent campaign to under mine the strength of the Bloc political warfare in political and economic dip somatic in the Up and propaganda and front the action of Communist and rolled trade outside the exploitation of subversive and revolutionary and of civil and psychology cal The principal of strength upon which Bloc political warfare are based will remain Bloc military which fear and and the strategic economic power and Other of Bloc political warfare strength are the highly organized Communist international al and the leadership and disc line of the individual Communist Communist which many as well as and the experience and professional skill of Soviet and subversive and of Soviet use of front the fixing of Communist purpose to impose Communism on the world and the unified direction of must action give the a tactical political warfare advantage in the and intensity of of action to be used against the list On the other there are which tend to place upon Bloc political warfare These include the limit of the Communist philosophy and the Communist world in rating political in the non Communist the Communist insistence upon the maintenance of totalitarian frequent between the of the Soviet Communist Party and the of other national Communist and awareness in the world since especially in the of the actual within the Bloc and of the aggressive Bloc political warfare depend upon the stability and power of the These would be seriously reduced if a and decisive struggle for power should develop within the Soviet must Party or if a struggle for power within the Soviet Communist Party should spread to the Soviet Army and the Soviet Security and should lead to open conflict with in or between these For some the new Soviet will not be able to achieve status as the symbol of the international Communist move and as the undisputed leader of World This may have an adverse fact upon outside the at least although we believe that the loyalty of the hard core of the Communist outside the Bloc will not be If there should be a struggle for power within the Soviet must the cohesion of the Communist movement would almost certainly be It is difficult to estimate how Bloc cal warfare will since they depend to a large degree not only upon the situation within the but also upon the success with which the world the to its stability which would exist even if there were no Communist Bloc political warfare would increase if the world should fail to maintain economic if nationalist in Western Eu rope should be if between the Up and its allies should undermine the program for Western and if nationalist in colonial should stimulate against the West Bloc political warfare capable would decrease if the world during the period of this estimate should succeed in or the from such as o P e s r Authority It is also difficult to estimate the develop of Bloc political warfare because they are in large part dependent on relative military strength of the Bloc If Western military strength and the should relative to that of the Bloc political warfare would pro able On the other fear of war and consequent vulnerability to Bloc political warfare would probably increase in the non Communist if the to deliver atomic should increase relative to Western and if the Bloc should improve its air relative to Western offensive Bloc Political Warfare We believe that during the period of this estimate Communist to establish Communist by political warfare will be most likely to increase in Southeast and the Middle In these the political and economic found of some are and polite cal are often sudden and Communist for infiltration and in correction may increase because of the in tense nationalism in those the social disintegration and economic dislocation which affect those and the time leadership of the These will probably remain in and will probably remain polite really and the Tue Party will The Director of Naval Intelligence that this paragraph should read as in order to render the military hypothesis more realistic and It is also difficult to estimate the development of Bloc political warfare because they are in large part dependent on the relative military strength of Bloc and the If Western military strength and cohesion should increase substantially relative to that of the Bloc political warfare would probably be or even decline In some On the other if the mile try strength of the Bloc should Increase sub

their capability to in fluency the of and will constitute the principal danger by Bloc political war The may be able to un determine support for Western of and for political and economic and they may be able to height among the of the Western For these they can ex plot national between the Western economic and trade na nationalism in colonial and dependent and dread of Western and In West and the Communist will retain a capability to harass to confuse and to interfere with parliamentary even though some of these will probably decline in size and in in these the Bloc may be able to use economic warfare with particular For the Bloc may be able to conclude and to fill trade to the trade pattern and to the export of the non Communist The retain the capability to use the German problem to un determine the Western program for defense and for This capability will be come increasingly dangerous unless Western is formally brought into the West coalition in the near future and unless the of

Date C f Authority PROBABLE ON DEVELOPMENT Of THE SOVIET AND WESTERN WER THE PROBLEM To estimate the probable relative development of the Soviet Bloc and Western power over the next fifteen with a view to whether or not time is on our side in the No general Continuation of the present general Western trend of of both the Bloc and the ESTIMATE We believe it essential to state at the outset that there is no unequivocal answer to the question time on our Even assume ing a of the present general trend of of both the Bloc and the Western an assumption of doubtful there are so many dental or unpredictable which will materially affect the world situation as to vent any firm estimate of the relative Soviet Bloc and Western power fifteen from Moreover on the side of the anti Communist taking the and neutrality there are so many divergent that it is difficult to speak of a consistent trend of Even within the chief force in the agreement of the to resist aggression against any one of How it is possible to praise in general our likely power position the Bloc if present continue and if various major alternative do or do not come to by examining the impact of The Western are taken to include the Up and its some of these we can at least establish certain significant which might alter present PROBABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH Of SOVIET AND THE The Soviet At present the economic strength of the Soviet Bloc is far less than that of the Western in of gross national product the out put of the entire Bloc is to have been about that of the Western assuming a continuation of present and the economic strength of the Soviet Bloc will increase greatly over the next For some the rate of growth of the Soviet economy will almost certainly remain higher that of any major Western the past rapid rate of which we estimate percent in is already leveling off and the annual rate toward the end of the For the purpose of these economic the Western include the the mean West and Authority period is unlikely to exceed Even total Soviet will probably almost within the next fifteen while Bloc as a whole will increase around per Bloc economic to wage war are likely to increase substantially since the Bloc will probably continue to place great emphasis on the development of heavy and in particular on military Bloc self already will probably be come more nearly These may be by other A struggle for power or internal dimension in the Soviet Bloc might dissipate Soviet A relaxation in the forced pace of heavy development would probably reduce the rate of increase in Bloc to wage a major The difficulty of rapidly increasing the industrial labor force in the and the probable lag in agricultural production may prove more serious limiting on general economic growth than we now On the other the application of known scientific de to Bloc though this would require would permit greater in Bloc agricultural production and the release of agricultural labor for other The It is more difficult to estimate the probable economic growth of the Western The free and less closely Western particularly those of the major Up are more vulnerable to comic and in international trade than are those of the Much will depend upon the ability of the Western to establish a pattern of production and of in international trade and which will provide such as the and Japan with adequate and in gen real will permit a steady economic Up and will be of critical importance in this assuming a continuation of present and no semi we estimate the probable growth in Up at about percent over the next fifteen and at almost per cent for the Western as a the Western will continue to face much greater than the So Bloc in and their re toward cold war and peace time for hot Their ability to impose peacetime will be and the of agreeing on common and among of different and sometimes divergent will remain difficult to While Bloc will probably increase at a higher rate than that of the Western and the ratio of Western superiority will therefore the of the West is al ready so much greater than that of the Bloc that the absolute gap between the two will widen despite the lower rate of Western Thus the West will remain for the indefinite future greatly superior to the Soviet Bloc in total economic certain decrease the sig of economic growth and re as a factor in the world power bal The ability of the totalitarian Soviet Bloc to devote a high percentage of its re both to the cold war and to peacetime military will probably remain greater than that of the for stated in the con winning economic superiority of the al though may not be the ruling tor in whether time is on our PROBABLE SCIENTIFIC Of THE AND THE SOVIET The scientific assets of the West and quality of trained and are now far greater than those of the Soviet and almost mainly will remain greater over the next fifteen the is expanding great To project these to Bloc is to increase on the order of percent while Western only thus the ratio to roughly in favor of the On the other the actual dis parity in favor of the West will become even from around billion to some billion by Authority to reduce this and is likely to narrow the gap between it and the even though the Western probably will pro due more basic scientific and will in to be better able to late into quantity production of high the Bloc may con centrale excessively on the solution of short term military and economic thus the of fundamental research and the probability of basic scion topic It is impossible to estimate whether the power between the Soviet Bloc and the West will be during the period of this estimate by any major tech biological breakthrough by either for as the initial production of the atomic bomb by the Up in PROBABLE In THE MILITARY Of THE AND THE SOVIET We believe that throughout the next if teen the West will maintain a substance till absolute advantage in for atomic but that the Bloc will grad rally reduce this Within the period of this estimate both Up and will produce a sufficient stockpile of atomic and possibly thermonuclear to the other if on The if it not already acquired this number of will do so before the Assuming a continuation of present gen real of of both the Bloc and the Western it is likely that within the period of this estimate the West and will each have the of delivery with which to the unless in de offensive and permit a sub spatial improvement over present defensive At that point the world will have a period in which both of the great power block have the capacity to the though only at equally grave risk of the purpose of this estimate to destroy quickly a very large proportion of the by the other side to wage general crippling in Unless it complete strategic surprise or an un technological we be live that neither side would be able to prevent powerful retaliation in In the absence of general the ruthlessness of the Soviet and the fear which they in spire among many Western may en able them to use the possession of atomic as an instrument of pressure in the cold The Up is if it not already its vulnerability to crippling and with it the immense strategic ad vantage of being able to conduct the trade finally deliberate and extensive We cannot estimate the time at which the will attain the capability to Up but it is probably well within the period of this At that despite probable Up re mention of a sizable margin of technological superiority and superior atomic offensive ca this continued disparity will become much less at least in regard to bombardment of strategic On the other the super of the West over the Bloc in atomic will nevertheless represent a consider enable because of tactical of atomic It is likely that the West during the period of this remain superior to the Soviet Bloc in for tactical use of atomic whether in general or in local The development of Bloc and Western power during the next fifteen will be significantly affected by their relative conventional military with or without the use of atomic Bloc military are being con and and will continue to pose a serious threat to around the Bloc The West will probably remain superior to the Bloc in of in the application of tech colony to military and in its ability to control the The West will increase sub spatially its relative power position if it can develop local military in key Authority around the Bloc periphery and can maintain capable of quick dispatch to such in case of attainment of the capability to defend Western and Japan against Soviet attack would significantly improve the power position of the The of these their geographical and their technological contribute substantially to Western The extent to which the West will attain the capability of these will depend on Western and other policy Much will also in this on the degree of progress which is made in regard to the armament and orientation of West and PROBABLE In THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STRENGTH AND COHESION Of THE SOVIET AND THE in Probable the Soviet Political and social will have an and perhaps effect on the relative power of the Bloc and the West and are most difficult to estimate over so long a period as the next fifteen During this period it is possible that a strut for control within the Kremlin might cause a retraction and decay of Soviet Whether such will take or at what extent they would begin to have a material effect on the power position of the Soviet Bloc cannot be at this At we see no that the economic and military bases of Soviet power have been affected by In any case we believe it unsafe to assume that over the next the Soviet regime will lose its stability or the Bloc its While the more flexible of the regime and the modest relax of tight Soviet may permit peri overt of discontent be hind the Iron over the long run these very may also tend to length the lease on The possibility that Communist China may attempt to play an independent increasingly Should this potential weakness develop into a break between the two chief Communist it would be a major loss to Soviet in the Political and Social Strength and Cohesion of the Because of the greater diversity of the loser Western coal and the variety of at within we find it even more difficult to project probable in Western strength and lesion as they affect the global balance of at no time in the foresee able future will the Western be likely to attain or to desire to attain the control to mobilize their character of the totalitarian Soviet In gen they will probably continue to be more subject to internal economic flute divisive than the Much will depend on international economic on future Soviet on the future position of major like Ger and above on the role by the acknowledged leader of the Western the Up As the only single aggregation of re outside the Up itself comparable to the Soviet Western a ma Its for role in the world power tinged such as dependence on Up lack of a sense of urgency regarding the Communist between and and and constitute a major vulnerability of the Western while Western acquisition by the Bloc would be a tremendous increment to Soviet The reappear of a strong and viable Western would substantially de crease Western vulnerability and alter the present power relationship between the Soviet Bloc and the West to the advantage of the On the other we see many to the achievement of this We live that a primary concern of the Kremlin over the coming period will be to the development of a viable and defensible Authority In this effort the Kremlin will almost certainly concentrate on the key to the the German If a shift in Soviet policy on for exam led the to accept a and neutral it would due a new factor of great significance into the world power Such a develop if accepted by our would not necessarily weaken the Western A and neutral would act as a buffer and if the were subsequently to abandon we be live that they would be more likely to align themselves with the West than with the The emergence of a must Japan would be a major asset in re the strategic balance in the Far the degree of future coop ration with the Up will depend largely on the extent to which the Western alignment not only needs for security and foreign but also its expect for economic and military aid and for treatment as an Probable in the Strength and Alignment of A major cult facing the West is by the extreme political and social instability of the of the Middle and Far East and where profound social are in in many disorder and consequent vulnerability to Communist The of this political and social revolt create an additional obstacle to the until nation by the West of the of these The consequent danger to the West position is acute in some of South east and the Middle None of these is likely to develop into an important center of power during the period of this but their loss would nevertheless be a serious blow to the For the loss of which is would probably result in eventual loss of most of tum Southeast This would lead to for stability in the and to greatly in the in Western orientation of A Communist in which is also would jeopardize the already unstable Western in the Middle On the other the trend toward greater instability and vulnerability to must influence in the is not Western control or influx once is still paramount in these Over the next the Up and its allies still have the opportunity to undertake which might arrest this trend and main tain that Possible Effects of a Kremlin Shift to Soft We believe that a lin shift to more moderate tactics would also present a real challenge to further growth in the military strength the cohesion of Western To date the Up in and partially a defensive coalition under the impetus of an acute Soviet Should this threat pear to it will be difficult to main tain the support of Western for con tinged close integration of na and vigorous The likelihood of among the Western especially if by skillful Kremlin would markedly in It might over the longer to some of our allies more neutral or even to the creation of a mean On the other a decrease of cold war might allow many Western to concentrate on domestic needs and to devote more to meeting their own economic and social It is that a armament would instead lead to unemployment of and A relaxation might also have an adverse effect on the cohesion and vitality of the world Communist and hence on the Soviet power Soviet are under some compulsion pursue an aggressive policy in order to serve the Communist ideology as a vital Any pronounced subduing of the hostility motif might serve to soften the of foreign Communist Authority and to breed restlessness in under Kremlin without keeping active the concept of permanent conflict be teen and might have difficulty in voluntary adherence of Communist China and and their willingness to undertake direct action in the interest of the In ME Of UR We believe that the Soviet Bloc under present and will over the next decrease the proportion by which its economic and technological are inferior to those of the West and will acquire sufficient atomic to the although the West will probably retain a sizable absolute margin of we believe that in these time must be said to be on the Soviet In other time may be on the side of the The military will increase during the next fifteen if conventional armament and of unconventional enhance its present defensive in overseas The extent to which these are likely to occur on Western and other policy can be within both the West and the Bloc which might undermine each political stability and these We cannot will have such effects and certainly we cannot say that they would do so within the period of this that now seem to be running against In the West in the these cannot be the cone quest growth of instability and Communist influence in these may eventually have serious effects on the economic stability and orientation of Western and While there is no reason at this time to predict the decay or the ability of certain adverse to its present strength and Internal rigidity may deprive the of that flex ability and vitality which contribute to a political survival and Al the Kremlin may decide to modify and relax its previous only to find that this relaxation adversely contain Soviet economic Satellite and It would be to assume that the pro less which are inherent in the Soviet system will of themselves have critical pro within the next fifteen Un less they the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system and the pervasive control or influence over its Bloc will continue to provide it with many over the less cohesive coalition led by the Even under the assumption of of the present general trend of in both the Bloc and the Western there are so many accidental or which could alter present that we are unable to conclude that time is on the side of either the Soviet Bloc or the Though a few of the of power can be with fair the relative development of the power of the West and Soviet Bloc cannot be

To negotiate for but with no intention of agreeing to any solution that would involve the relinquishment of Soviet control over East We estimate that the is unlikely to adopt the first recent in the Soviet Union and else where in the Bloc suggest the possibility of some change in Soviet The Kremlin might cane to the conclusion that a solution of the German problem could no longer be and yet could

Uncertainty in Stockpile In view of the uncertainty in the evidence concerning the production of the stockpile for future may be as low as less than the figure given for or as high as twice that

evidence of the develop of jet medium A prototype heavy bomber probably powered by piston been It may lately be powered by This type of aircraft is not known to be in series There have been recent of aircraft reportedly than the These if confirmed as heavy bomber would establish that at least production It safe to assume that the is to replace the piston medium bomber with aircraft of higher performance The following the actual strength and composition of the Soviet long range bomber force through is on the assumption that the will initiate series production of a jet medium bomber during the period of this estimate and that the series production of a heavy bomber in Intelligence presently available does not rule out the table of ability that series production of a heavy bomber could

creation of a heavy bomber No intelligence is available concerning Soviet insight refueling I flight refueling do not pose serious technical and the had access to the and equip employed by the Up in this With one refueling of a its combat radius could be from nautical to approximately nautical and its range to nautical Future Jet Medium Bomber It is that a jet medium bomber could appear in operational use some time in Such a bomber would have altitude and speed but less range than a Although little genre is available in this it been calculated that such an aircraft might have a combat radius of and a combat range of nautical carrying a pound bomb A Soviet jet medium bomber ing these could reach in the United only on a son from the base On such a mission it could reach north of an

operate from Northeast on a basis with one refueling against any where in the United and without against north and west of an arc drawn generally from central through central New Logistics are difficult in the but these could be mixed by advance and use of the area for staging bases attack ing the United from Northeast would have favorable tail most of the There are now no known air which

Basic such a range would enable to attack north and east of a line drawn generally from South through Mon All of the northeastern industrial term of the United could be from either The character stick

semi only disrupt radio community between the continental Up and its overseas We further believe that the will increase the effectiveness of its equipment as well as the pro efficiency and number of its trained personnel throughout the period of this It is probable that the pro used sufficient electronic to equip some It is not known whether Soviet have in fact been with such equip or what would be the effectiveness of those against Up defensive Use of effective equipment might require the employment of extra aircraft specially for this DELIVERY Of CONVENTIONAL AND MASS DESTRUCTION By THE MAS

intelligence are available that the from these are of low or undetermined reliability and have not been It is conceivable that the type could be fitted with an atomic although there is no indication that the either such a type or incorporated it in a It is that the would not attempt to improve this missile type in regard to range or but would accent the of and the of rapid prepare and firing from the The carried forward the development of the German type ballistic this missile could not pro due a threat against the continental Up during the period of this CLANDESTINE DELIVERY Atomic The is capable of atomic which could be into the Up either as complete or as component or sub The could range from T or weighing a few hundred to yield up to weigh thousand Their size ing several could range from that of a package small enough to fit into the luggage compartment of an automobile to that of a case large enough to contain an All of these could be designed to break down into a number of relatively simple and readily transportable Those designed to give a relatively low yield would not require much labor or tech training to Somewhat more labor and training would be to as female designed to give high once they would be more difficult to It is conceivable that only the fashionable in small need be into the since other could be or in this This would require careful ad dance and by super visor personnel with engineering skill and familiarity with the Up of and would take a longer time to carry It would probably result in a reduced yield for a given amount of fission able It would incur a substantially greater security risk than the clandestine introduction of all A variety of of clandestine delivery suggest could be by apparently friendly air could be in the hold of a merchant or could be sown as water Either or asset led could be brought in under across land or sea through normal import or brought in as bonded merchant The selection of the method of introduction and of port and assembly within the Up would de end on the Soviet objective and the risk of detection which the was willing to Considering the known of the of physical it is probable that the could introduce into the Up and detonate in place a considerable number of atomic by clandestine However the would have to take into account not only the of but also the of posse detection in forgetting the element of surprise in any intended overt attack and in provoking Up As the number of clandestine was in the risk of compromise would in This risk would be less a function of Up for physical de section than of the scope and complexity of the clandestine particularly into of Soviet far as the cone Considering of a breach of the would probably be unwilling to risk the use of even selected and trained in such as would be involved in a clandestine attack on a scale comparable to that which might be overtly by We although time attack with atomic might occur against specially selected as a supply to overt delivery by such an on a scale comparable to that which might be overtly by would probably be by security We have no evidence to indicate whether or not the actually made any or for the clandestine delivery of atomic Biological Some By are peculiar adaptable to clandestine introduce The introduction of small of By would be difficult to detect or identify as to but Soviet would be their dis A large number of people would be for extensive dissemination of By and Soviet security would be a limiting factor in the scale and timing of such an for Chemical C are not easily adaptable to clandestine In add to the noted above as applied to By C are easily idea by their immediate effects and it probably would not feasible to build up sufficient or to procure the clandestine for their dissemination against large population The most table use would be against personnel in key but even this would be We have no evidence to indicate whether or not the is the for the clandestine delivery of chemical ATTACK Of THE Up IT CONVENTIONAL AND FORCE Conventional Naval Attack Soviet for the Up with naval conventional armament are The Soviet surface fleet is geographically advance limited operational and does not possess a air Its minor combatant amphibious are entirely united for transoceanic The Soviet merchant which would be upon to provide the could not be into an efficient auxiliary element to amphibious on any significant The only substantial naval threat to the Up which the could muster would be that of its submarine In addition to its potential in connection with the delivery of mass destruction the submarine force at least in the initial phases of a inflict serious damage on Up overseas and carry out offensive mining in the shipping to principal Up It is that during the period of this estimate the sub marine force will be enlarged and by the introduction of additional of ocean patrol by the progress modernization of and by the possible adaptation of to size Attack Soviet for attack upon the continental Up are also very could be for service and operate within the same and under the same cond as the We have no dance to indicate whether or not the made any for the dropping of air borne in the but the if it drop specially trained assault and sabotage for attack upon important but difficult E C R E ART In CERTAIN AFFECTING SOVIET EMPLOYMENT Of THE FOREGOING ASSUMING A SOVIET DECISION To ATTACK THE Up The Soviet would expect a direct attack on the United to precipitate general In such a war the Soviet would expect to have an initial ponderance of military power on the Era span but in their attack upon the continental Up would be concerned to Up retaliatory air attack on the Soviet Union with of mass mobilization of the superior war potential of the Western particularly that of the and Up rein enforcement of in The Soviet have their sensitivity to the danger of Up air attack with of mass destruction by the high priority which they have given to the develop of against such an Despite the substantial progress already in building up their it is unlikely that they would regard their de offensive as adequate to prevent substantial of aircraft from reaching strategic in the It is that in atomic warfare the would be to destroy or Up for retaliation in with particular refer once to continental and overseas to deliver such an attack on industrial and psychological in the United as would or at least the mobilization of the Up war and to retain the to counter any Up rein enforcement of As among the available and weak ons for the continental the highest capability in open mile try attack with atomic by type for the following The low of conventional naval and The security inherent in the delivery of comparable of atomic by clandestine Other of delivery of atomic are insufficiently for large scale use Other mass destruction are in sufficiently or subject to other handicap in their The Soviet employ other of the Up concur gently with or immediately following an open and direct atomic In the of submarine and biological Soviet at best appear to be severely They have a greater capability for chemical attack in connection or subset quest atomic Clandestine attack in the form of sabotage or biological warfare might occur at any and without an overt attack ever being The must weigh the timing and value of the sabotage in relation to their complete plan of attack and its effect upon the capability of the United to launch a retaliatory military Clan attack with atomic might occur against specially selected as a supplement to overt delivery by Subsequent to an overt clandestine at tack in any form could be to the maximum practicable We believe that the affect ing Soviet employment of their will remain throughout this essentially the same as those outlined

The following member Committee the Genre the preparation of intelligence of the the the the Air and the En T A L C SEC i I i i h Authority SOVIET THROUGH To estimate Soviet Bloc through THE PROBLEM No general war within the period of this ASSUMPTION There is no evidence that the basic economic and military strength of the Soviet or the authority of the Soviet have been by develop since the death of We be live it unlikely that appreciable weak ending in these will occur during the period of this Despite the recent in East we believe that the will be able to maintain effective control there and in the other nation with the succession to and bureaucratic confusion following the fall of Eerie may lead to occasional under mainly in Bloc tactics and resistance in on both foreign and Soviet economic growth will probably continue during the period of this mate at a rate higher than that main in any major al though the very great superiority of the total volume of production over that of the Bloc will in fact be slightly There are various that the Bloc may in the near future vote a somewhat greater proportion of to the production of and a smaller proportion to the production of capital than in the recent we believe it likely that the general of Bloc comic development which have been since will be significantly The most significant increase in Bloc military during the period of this estimate will arise from enlargement of the Bloc stockpile of atomic and from an increase in the number of its jet aircraft and its The Bloc may by available a sufficient number of heavy to increase greatly its air offensive capable A limited number of jet interceptor may also be in in Bloc air defense We do not believe that marked in Bloc military strength and capable are likely to occur in other there will be a general improve in training and equipment of Bloc armed l Authority On August an to the Supreme Soviet that the United no longer had a monopoly in the production of the hydrogen no Soviet explosion of a nuclear device yet been The statement may have been pure or it may have been inspired by the attainment of a specific stage of development short of an actual We believe that the latter interpret station is the Bloc political warfare will remain especially in and but will vary in accordance with in world and in each country or Soviet Bloc capable for the more violent of political such as armed rebellion and guerrilla are in the un and colonial of South far less so in South the east and In Western Eu particularly and and in certain Communist political warfare are considerable for and the exploitation of economic Nearly all are susceptible to some form of and diplomatic although such would be more effective in Southeast than in Western DISCUSSION AFFECTING Political The among top Soviet lead ers since the death of are not yet The arrest of established the fact that there was sharp dimension within the highest Soviet It is not yet clear whether this dimension arose principally from a strut for personal power or from over basic nor whether fall ended the There is no evidence that the authority of the regime been by since and we believe it unlikely that this authority will break down within the period of this or even be appreciable We are Bloc on this internal political develop since the death of and really the arrest of have almost mainly produced anxiety and perhaps some confusion in the Soviet It is possible that Soviet and Satellite will be preoccupied for a considerable time with the by the transfer of These may produce occasional under mainly in tactics and hesitant in on both foreign and we do not believe that these will act to impair the basic economic and military strength of the Nor do we believe that the Soviet will cease to base their policy on their conviction of an irreconcilable utility between the Bloc and the list We believe that Soviet ability to maintain effective control in the not been by anything that since the death of Soviet suppression of the in East the thoroughness of that con while at the same time that the Satellite themselves may be without Soviet armed force in re to maintain their in sub section to the will of the The posse ability that the Satellite will be The current critical situation in be in an estimate now in a more detailed account of this see the Appendices to this estimate Authority to follow the example of popular resistance in East may require the Soviet to devote more and to the problem of control in the and thus somewhat reduce Bloc The Communist regime firm control over the territory which it There is little likelihood of this control being or shaken by domestic within the period of this The of Communist China to the are more those of an ally than a The alliance is based on a common ideology and at least a temporary community of in which is not likely to be affected by in Kremlin We that Mao Tung may take the opportunity increasingly to pursue Comma list own possibly to the detriment of Soviet authority over Comma in that Termination of hostile in will make Communist economic and military dependence on the less though this dependence will continue to limit Communist capacity for independent Economic The Soviet Bloc is in a strong modern heavy and adequate of nearly all the natural further to develop its industrial The of the are being progressively with that of the in the of pro moving Bloc and the growth of Bloc military production ing the period of this Soviet Bloc economy will be capable of supporting a major war The gross national product of the Bloc will probably increase during the period of this estimate at an average annual rate of between and The increase in the alone will probably be at an annual rate of between and This Soviet rate of growth will almost certainly be higher than the rate which the Up or any major Western state will the total output of the Soviet economy will remain much lower than that of the and the output of the entire Bloc will remain much lower than that of the We estimate that Soviet was about one quarter to that of the Up in and that the of the entire Bloc was about that of the These in ratio may be re used slightly during the period of this although the in absolute will probably be The and especially the will probably continue to concentrate upon ex padding the industrial Growth of production will probably lag behind growth of industrial We mate that about of Soviet is now devoted to military and that the proportion will probably remain at about this level through the period of this There are various that the Bloc may in the near future devote a somewhat greater proportion of to the production of and a smaller proportion to the production of capital than in the recent These are with respect to East many and but they are not for the As yet they are client to form a basis for an estimate that significant in Bloc economic policy have or are likely to We believe it unlikely that any which may be made in Bloc economic policy will significantly alter either the basic emphasis upon development of heavy industry and military potential or the general of Bloc economic development which have been since and on which our present estimate of probable future Bloc economic is largely Military We estimate that the size of Bloc being will not increase substantially by The program for increasing Bloc mile try strength will continue to modernization of the armed and en argument of the atomic i I I I Authority We estimate that by the will have a stockpile of approximately atomic In view of our uncertainty concerning the pro auction of fashionable particularly the number of atomic may be as low as or as high as On August to the Supreme Soviet that the United no longer had a monopoly in the production of the hydrogen no Soviet explosion of a thermonuclear device yet been and we cannot be confident that a militarily significant weapon will have been until such a test explosion been do know that basic re search which may be related to the there nuclear program is being carried and the a growing capacity for quantity production of which could be used in the development of thermonuclear weak Field testing of thermonuclear read based on or independent research may take place at any How there is insufficient evidence to cate the degree of priority assigned by the to its thermonuclear The statement may have been pure or it may have been inspired by the attainment of a specific stage of develop short of an actual We believe that the latter interpretation is the more The of Bloc and air will almost certainly con to increase during the period of this mate as a result of the following in in the of modern aircraft and naval increase in the number of atomic progressive We believe that yielding kill are probably within Soviet capability and that the could make low as In the event that the should choose to stockpile of smaller or the number of weak ons in the stockpile would be modernization and standardization of weak ons and particularly those incur electronic guidance and in combat efficiency of Communist and of at least some Satellite and improvement of the logistical and stocks of war the Bloc armed will con to be by certain in and equip for strategic air and air de lack of ability to conduct amphibious and naval and the logistic from the size of Bloc territory and the relatively inadequate road and rail network and merchant The relative reliability of Satellite armed is a factor detrimental to Bloc military If political tension and popular resistance in the the may find the military usefulness of Satellite and Satellite greatly MILITARY We estimate that the Bloc now theta ability to concurrent in continental the Middle and The Bloc could re enforce with Communist and Soviet the Communist now in and at the same time undertake an invasion of Japan by Soviet Bloc naval for the ocean going and new and de as now are designed to protect Bloc coastal and the award flank of a ground the of the new construction now and the increasing between Naval Aviation and the Fleet indicate a growing emphasis on offensive estimate of the success of these can be made without considering the effects of the of opposing Authority P S E R E With respect to mine the now the capability of seriously interfering with Allied sea In the this effort could include all the and of the Up and Western In the Far most of the vital Allied port and sea around the perimeter of the Bloc could be similarly The Soviet Navy will have no capability within the period of this but it will remain capable of mounting amphibious in considerable The Soviet submarine force will in crease its capability to undertake offensive and mining along most of the strategically vital sea and if the specialized craft have been simultaneously to launch missile against on both the Atlantic and Pacific seaboard of the The now the capability to un concurrent air against the the continental the Middle and the offshore island chain of against the Up would be much more difficult than those against the other The the capability to reach all of the Up and to attempt the delivery of its full stockpile of atomic even a stripped down could reach only the extreme northwestern corner on without aerial Even with aerial re and other range extension attack upon the northeastern industrial area and upon most of the principal strategic bases almost certainly would involve the expand true of the aircraft and most of the on Until it a heavy bomber available for operational the will not have the capability to reach believe the capable of sub to this but we have no evidence to indicate that such have been No estimate of the success of these can be made without considering the effects of the of opposing believe that the the capability to utilize range extension but we have no evidence that any of these have been most of the strategically important in the Up on A heavy bomber may already be in production if it be assumed that series production in about may be available by We estimate that the Bloc the ability of providing vigorous opposition against air on critical in the interior of the under of good visit Under clear moonlight night Bloc defense are fair against ton and negligible against jet bomb Under of poor day or Bloc interception are Currently known point to an in crease of Bloc air defense during the period of this It is that intercept equip will come into operational use during this Although the future develop and availability of is based on Ger man could be available now or in the immediate A limited number of all weather jet interceptor may be in operation by we cannot estimate the significance of these real time to future air offensive POLITICAL WARFARE It is probable that Bloc for political warfare against the world have been temporarily reduced by the of power to new leadership in the Kremlin and by the of dis session which have the we believe that the weakness and confusion which have marked the of Communist political warfare in recent will be overcome within a short time unless the authority of the Soviet should be to a greater degree than we have is more detailed sec for Attack on the Up through August For detailed discussion of Bloc political warfare and see Appendix C of this l Authority Bloc political warfare will de end to a large degree not only upon the situation within the Bloc but also upon the success with which the world the to its stability which would exist even if there were no Communist Thus Bloc political warfare would increase if the economic in the world should if nationalist antagonism in West should be if between the Up and its allies should under mine the program for Western de and if nationalist in should stimulate against the Western Bloc political warfare would decrease if the list world during the period of this estimate should avoid the from pro less such as The relative military strength of the Bloc and the West is also a factor political warfare Increase or de crease of Bloc military strength real time to that of the West would almost certainly produce some corresponding increase or de crease in Bloc political warfare Fear of war and consequent vulnerability to Bloc political warfare would probably grow rapidly in some of the world if it widely that the in atomic warfare had significantly relative to those of the This vulnerability to political warfare would be if it were widely be lived that the Bloc had markedly its air relative to Western offensive Bloc political warfare will be determined to a great extent by the impression which the world of the general character of Bloc The new leadership in the Kremlin for resume the policy of obvious and aggressive hostility to the probably thereby to insure the unity of the world Communist movement and to promote fear and despair among On the other the Kremlin may attempt by as well as by propaganda to persuade the world that its basic are conciliatory and that a fundamental change in fact with the passing of The Kremlin might thus expect to attain some of its by complacency rather than fear among Western It might hope that such a course of action among other tend to weaken the lesion of the alliance and reduce the level of defense which Western will be willing to Bloc political warfare vary greatly throughout the We believe that during the period of this estimate must to establish Communist by political warfare will be in and In other of the Communist to influence the of and the of govern will constitute the principal danger by Bloc political Western Various out of the German problem can be by the to di video the Western and to undermine Western defense So long as Ger many remains agitation of the Ger man unity question will remain an effective weapon of Bloc political both in Ger many and in Western If Western Ger many is brought into the Western or if is and is not brought into the Western the German pro would continue to offer the poor unity for dimension and The Communist of and are the only Communist in West that have significant for political During the period of this estimate these will probably not be able to gain participation in the or otherwise to acquire direct influence over national On the other given the strong social discontent within these count the voting strength and mass following of the will probably be main at approximately the present Authority They will therefore retain a capability to harass to confuse and to discredit parliamentary More this capability would be dignified if the centrist lose strength to the right and thus increasing govern mental In Western but par in and Bloc for economic and for political action would increase sharply if there should be any serious decline in the level of economic active labor which at present are unable to lead the mass of into political would recover this In these Bloc economic which is not now an import want aspect of Bloc political could become increasingly un less the Bloc its basic economic it will not be able within the period of this estimate to provide for large quan of In any the Bloc will be unable to supply a significant pro portion of the goods for which Western Eu rope is now dependent on overseas As a practical the Bloc the capability to bring about a major shift in present trade a relatively small increase in the volume of trade which certain now carry on with the could have an appreciable economic effect in those and possibly a more significant psychological Southeastern Bloc political warfare will re main negligible in Southeastern The inclusion of and Turkey in and the recently Pact between and have reduced greatly the political effectiveness of Bloc mile try strength in this we be live that the Bloc will be through conciliatory tactics and normalization of to reverse the Western orientation of these are currently in progress in preparation for Bloc for comic for publication in Middle East and During the period of this estimate Bloc political warfare in the Middle East and North will be favored by the continuation of strong political and social tur and economic The will be most favorable to Communism in In and the military in power will probably limit must In the Middle East gen really the Bloc will find it difficult to develop effective of political warfare out of the local Communist The Bloc could intensify Middle East by anti Western by providing some sup port to either side in the conflict with or by large of for emigration to It might in crease neutrality sentiment and create some good will by of trade and military assist Communist in North are relatively significant already

probable of action of the Soviet Bloc through We see no sign that the ideological dynamic of the Communist regime is acting and we believe that the Comma remain profoundly convinced that permanent hostility between the Communist and the free Their basic continue to be an expansion of their own sphere of power and the eventual domination of the I It unlikely that the Kremlin during the period of this consider the relative to those of the West as sufficient to warrant deliberate initiation of general We further believe that Bloc will try to avoid of action which in their judgment might involve substantial risk of general We also believe it un likely that the Bloc will initiate new local aggression with identifiable Bloc during the period of this since the Communist probably estimate that virtually any new local mile try aggression would now entail sub spatial risk of general war or political seriously adverse to Bloc It is always of that the Kremlin will deem some act of local armed aggression sufficiently genus to make the risk worth despite its reluctance to run substantial of general the Kremlin might through adopt some course of action such a We also believe that the Kremlin would not be deferred by the risk of general war from taking counter action against a Western action which it considered to present an imminent threat to Bloc It is thus possible that a series of and by either could lead to gen real war even though not intended by either side to have that During the period of this estimate the Communist will conduct a via porous political campaign to un determine the Western power At present the Kremlin to be trying to give the impression that it adopted a more conciliatory policy than that Political warfare diplomatic both through normal intergovernmental and in such International organize as the propaganda and front active political and economic and in the action of Communist and of trade outside the infiltration of or their into key governmental and the

dimension between the Up and its and to delay the progress of Western We cannot how long such comparatively con tactics will it is to be that harsh of action similar to those by the Kremlin in the past will reappear whenever the Kremlin them We believe that Bloc during the period of this estimate will probably be prepared to reach an on some minor and may make plausible but unacceptable on major they will al most certainly be unwilling to settle any at the cost of major We that the Bloc will be extremely can in conciliatory and may revert from time to time to demon of especially when they consider that their vital are or that their tactics are being abroad as a sign of to negotiate may be by that the now proved in the nuclear weak ons and as these further the Kremlin may become in

to be particularly In the Far the will attempt to use the problem as well as other in the area to en courage division between the Up and its While it is unlikely that they will break the armistice by hostile in they will almost certainly not agree to unification on any which would endanger Communist control of North It is unlikely even as part of a general Far East the be willing to end the war except on the basis of a complete withdrawal of Western Elsewhere in the probably estimate that are not favorable for new at local armed though they will exploit any occur and will continue to support those which are now in The Bloc will continue to give highest priority to the rapid development of heavy to increase consumer goods production may require some ad in economic but will not alter this basic and will not result in any curtailment of the military The Bloc armament program during this period will be directed toward ionization and improvement of the armed Soviet policy with respect to

increasing production of nuclear to ping additional of nuclear weak to improving for the delivery of such and to ing air DISCUSSION INTRODUCTION Cohesion of the Bloc The ability of the Kremlin to determine the of Bloc policy does not pear to have been by the death of or by subsequent political develop within the We believe that the Bloc will preserve its cohesion through the of this estimate and that the Kremlin will continue to play the dominant role in the formulation of Bloc There have been some of pop lar disaffection and even of popular resistance within the Satellite Such resistance may be a factor in the and pure ing of individual Satellite and may induce the Kremlin to slow the tempo of Sovietization and industrialization which it of the Satellite How we believe that the Satellite govern will continue to be responsive to We believe that during the period of this estimate common ideology and common utility to the West will keep the and Communist China closely While must military and economic de sentence on the will the end of the the urgency of Basic Underlying Bloc Policy Despite the death of and the access son to power of a new generation of Soviet we see no sign that ideological dynamic of the Communist regime is bat and we believe that the Communist remain profoundly convinced that permanent hostility between the Communist and the free Their basic continue to be an expansion of their own sphere of power and the eventual domination of the Basic of the Communist concept of struggle against the world appear to have been confirmed by the Nine teeth Party Congress of and by doctrinal utterance since One is that the struggle will continue through a whole historical with historical working inevitably to favor the increase of Communist and the decline of Unremitting struggle on the part of the is an essential part of this but an early resolution of the contest is not necessarily to be and need not be Another Communist principle is that the form of the global struggle is not necessarily except possibly in its final and cataclysmic when the list become desperate as their power and their instability The Communist must be to in crease its own economic and military potent till while simultaneously to re due power by political war fare against From these it that the Kremlin would not deliberately ate general war unless it convinced Bloc had a decisive superiority early especially if the lin felt that this superiority would be short war was in any case imminent and it wished to have the advantage of the initial or a united and determined West coalition was increasing its military power to such a decisive make eventual retreat from considered vital to the security of the only alternative to an ultimate general We Authority do not believe that the Kremlin will reach any of these the period of this and we therefore be live it unlikely that the Kremlin will rarely initiate general KREMLIN ESTIMATE Of PRESENT STATION We that during the period of this estimate the Communist will continue to consider general war a hazardous at a minimum the certainty of wide spread destruction in the and at the same time carrying with it the risk that the Soviet system itself would be They know that the Up superior strategic power naval a atomic and greater industrial al though they probably estimate that the is making substantial progress toward reduce ing its in these We that the Kremlin will try to avoid of action which in its judgment might involve substantial risk of general The Communist almost certainly regard the Western alliance and its rear together with to add a West and Japan to the all as a potential threat to Bloc we believe that the Kremlin is not likely to conclude that the West will be mile family or psychologically prepared within the period of this estimate to initiate general war i against the The Communist probably estimate that most allied with the in the absence of a clear cut and immediate threat to their own vital will probably not be willing to adopt more aggressive toward the They probably also estimate in the since of such a economic and popular and political will tend to prevent expansion of the Western armament and even to make difficult the maint dance of that effort at present able estimate that there is practically no area of the world where Bloc could initiate overt military aggression without grave risk of Western military which might lead to general war or to political cone seriously adverse to Bloc therefore believe it unlikely that the Bloc will deliberately initiate new with identifiable Bloc armed during the period of this The Bloc continue to encourage and when diet to give material support to indigenous insurrection and civil especially j It is always of that the Kremlin will deem some act of local armed aggression sufficiently advantageous to make risk worth despite its reluctance to run substantial of general the Kremlin might through adopt some course of action such a We also believe that the Kremlin would not be deferred by the risk of general war from taking contraction against a Western action which it considered to present an imminent threat to Bloc It is thus possible that a series of and by either could lead to general war even though not intended by either side to have that The Communist apparently be live that the Western despite its growing military is afflicted by grave internal which will progress lively reduce its capability for united They seem to for that the world is entering a period in which of interest among its separate national will sharply They apparently believe also that Western solidarity will be by nationalist among the major Western and by nationalist revolt in the Middle and Bloc probably realize that the Western system of and the re armament since have greatly the risk that new local aggression will be met by Western military They PROBABLE We that the immediate of the Bloc in present phase of its struggle with the world are to continue to build its power Authority and economic to create and exploit and in the must to disrupt the coalition of Western and in particular to isolate the Up from its and Static to mobilize resistance within the Western to the and armament scored by and to deter from joining the Western alliance those presently or to persuade them to adopt favorable to the PROBABLE Of ACTION Within the Bloc The Bloc will continue to give highest priority to the rapid development of heavy industry and to the integration of its several national the and some have recently in the standard of living if fully would increase the rate of growth the production of consumer goods or raise the volume of of such There are also that sure on the agricultural population may be We believe that the Communist lead ers may be their economic pro in order to allow greater for industrial and and thereby to maintain or increase worker productivity and popular in present economic will represent no change in the basic policy of giving primary emphasis to heavy will not be al lower to endanger effective political and will not result in any curtailment of the military effort The will almost certainly devote strenuous to improving the political security and military usefulness of the lite The new leadership in the lin may undertake personnel or even in Satellite and security will probably be made to raise living wherever this is possible without basic economic to insure the reliability and to increase the military effectiveness of Satellite armed will be given priority over to increase their The will assist the industrialization of Communist though more probably in the form of and technical advice than of The own needs and the limited capability of the to absorb capital goods will continue to limit shipment of such The may concede must China a greater voice in the direction of Communist in but will con to insist that the have the decisive voice in the determination of Bloc global Despite possible both the and Communist China are to make every effort to preserve a united front the The Bloc armament program during this period will be directed toward modernization and improvement of the armed with out substantially increasing their Par titular attention will almost certainly be given to increasing production of nuclear to additional of nuclear to improving for the delivery of such and to proving air Beyond the Bloc General We believe that the Bloc during the period of this estimate will almost certainly be un willing to settle any at the cost of major The Bloc lead ers probably believe that the present stalemate over major in and can be for a considerable period without serious disadvantage to and with some of an eventual split in the Western they are probably prepared to reach an accommodation on some minor and may make plausible but unacceptable on major They probably hope that such tactics will carry an implication to the free world of an statement of the Bloc military threat and of a Bloc willingness to negotiate important is Minor thus in the might lead to a further relaxation of Western arms and to among Western over the of major t f Authority to stress Bloc diplomacy and propaganda will probably continue the theme and the willingness of Bloc to enter for the of in international for We that the Bloc will be extremely cautious in conciliatory and may re vert time to time to of especially when they consider that their vital are or that their tactics are being abroad as a sign of to negotiate may be by that the now an capability in the nu clear and as these further the Kremlin may become in its with the Fur Soviet may be intransigent in that concrete be on would support what we believe to be the at to make no major settle no major and to promote division in the Western These their During the period of this estimate the Communist will conduct a vigorous political warfare campaign to undermine the Western power At present the Kremlin to be trying to give the session that it adopted a more tory policy than that in later The Kremlin may estimate that this will give new effectiveness to their diplomacy as well as to such as the and divisive nationalist and trade They probably also estimate that conciliatory will enable the Communist in to broaden their popular support by into united national capable of agitation divisive among must and armament We cannot predict how long such comparatively conciliatory tactics will con it is to be that harsh of action similar to those by the Kremlin in the past will reappear whenever the Kremlin them There are recent that the Bloc to increase its trade with non Communist The volume of trade with the free world will probably in crease somewhat during the period of this but this trade will continue to be very small in proportion to New trade will probably be in not only to obtain desired but also to weaken the economic of non Communist with the and to make strategic trade a bone of contention between these and the While the Bloc will not be able to bring a major shift in present trade the Comma probably estimate that political div can be from even small in their current of trade with visual Western left and In Western the Bloc will aim at dividing and weakening Bloc may combined with the agitation of must and front will attempt to un determine popular support for present of armament and alliance with the The best for these tactics are in and where Communist voting strength remains dangerously high and can be used to apply leverage against the non Communist the center will probably be the principal target of such since it is a keystone of the Western defense system and since its perilous economic condition and political con fusion it the most vulnerable to in eternal disruption and external In crease of aid to the Min in may serve the duel purpose of deepening the internal crisis and with its The will also play upon of in order to prevent support for the program of West in all with the In the immediate aim remains to prevent the armament of West and its alliance with the It may agree to Four Power on German but is unlikely to conclude a I Authority settlement until it confident that the government which would result from it would be favorable to Soviet in The Kremlin probably that a united and Ger many would eventually align itself with the and that a withdrawal from East Ger many under present would weaken the Soviet position in the It is not that the Kremlin will at any early date agree to a settlement of the German question on these it is possible that the might in certain conclude that would be better by a settlement a unified and It might come to be live that such a settlement could set in train a course of in the West which would justify sacrifice of the present Soviet hold on East If by paying the price of withdrawal from East the could obtain withdrawal of Up from and possibly from it might consider the bargain a good We believe it unlikely that the will act on such a calculation within the period of this It is also unlikely that the Kremlin will consent to an treaty so long as the German question The Kremlin might become willing to accept an treaty which it would serve as a precedent for a German settlement ad advantageous to the So long as the Kremlin does not conclude that an settlement could have substantial political effects on the situation in it will probably prefer to retain at least some of the military and economic it from its occupation of The apparently on a program of de the military and direct control of the and it may make further unilateral to the Far East It is unlikely that the Comma will break the armistice by in They will remain to exploit the military which would be to them if the army stick were broken by unilateral action of South but we to do so at the destruction of and Up They might consider that greater political would result From merely taking defensive action against South if the latter broke the a resumption of the will probably attempt to use the forthcoming political to encourage between the Up and its allies over the settlement and other Far Eastern They will almost certainly not agree to Ko read unification on any which would endanger Communist control of North although they will press vigorously for the withdrawal of all foreign They are probably prepared to pursue the political diplomatic struggle without recourse to military action in North at least through the period of this estimate Communist strategy toward pan is probably based on the nation that a revival of nationalism and desire to play a more independent role together with urgent need for add will ultimately undermine the The Communist Party will probably con to emphasize and nationalist and resistance to Bloc diplomacy may hold out the prospect of re in connection with a peace of some island now by the even in advance of a will almost certainly extend trade and make con sessions on minor such as fishing We think it unlikely even as part of a general Far Eastern settle the would be willing to end the war except on the basis of complete withdrawal of Western The war is not costly to the Bloc and the Bloc probably estimate that the heavy drain on in will ultimately force the to terminate Authority the war on which would insure eventual Communist control in The Chi nose may further increase their material support to the but there are no present that must combat will invade or that identifiable Communist will be engaged on a significant in the

support anti Western political action against and the build up of party and in preparation for direct action as this may become feasible in particular The will continue its to divert the trade of Static from the West to the Middle East and The Middle East and will probably continue during the period of this estimate to be routine of the Bloc political war fare effort to undermine the Western except for we do not believe that the Bloc will devote major attention to these Trade will probably be made to Middle Eastern particularly those like whose economic position is Bloc to the Up will

Actual Up Commitment In the initial of an actual mile try the might not feel to intervene openly in force They would recognize the which the Up would face in acting in the climate and They would also realize that the xenophobia of the indigenous population of might be effectively to the page of Up by Communist the would therefore that the Up rather than themselves be con fronted with this

decisive defeat of the Min armed was they would be faced with the decision whether Communist China should intervene openly in force order to avert this The following might induce the to decide in favor of open intervention in Decisive defeat of the Min armed would be a grave blow Communist prestige throughout the world and would semi only diminish for the expansion of Communism in A Up military commitment in might form part of a possibly in in the of the the resurgence of Nationalist at the destruction of the must In any decisive defeat of the Min armed would bring Up to the of Whatever the initial success Up military action in might en courage the Up to increase pressure on other of the Communist Many particularly in the neutrality would consider the Up in the wrong in and would condone Chi nose Communist intervention as a move to from imperial These could be effectively by Communist The despite its might not retaliate strongly against Communist because it would fear that such retaliation would alienate its result in military deployment of Up cause ping to invoke the and thereby increase the danger of general By openly in force the Chi nose might be able to prevent in definitely both the successful accomplishment of the Up mission and the disengagement substantial Up from On the other the following consider might deter the from decide ing to intervene

involved in the de text of the Min armed could in part be offset by the Min as an indigenous liberation the Min Government and its armed could be on soil where they could exercise constant military and political pressure on the of the Up and the Associated The military and political nature of the war is such that even if the Up the Min field guerrilla action could probably be continued indefinite ly and preclude the establishment of complete control over that Under such the Up might have to maintain a military commitment in for to Heavy Up in over the long run might cause concern to Up allies and might create divergence between the Up and The Director of Central Intelligence and the Deputy Director for The Joint believe that the Communist reaction to commitment of Up in would

seek to avoid of action which would bring about In such the such are better than even that the would not openly intervene even if they that failure to intervene would mean the defeat at that time of

DURING THE PROBLEM To estimate the current situation and probable in Finland during We believe that internal comic and political while semi are not of crisis and will probably be somewhat alleviate during the coming The national in will probably not result m any significant alteration Power thus to remain with the center The value of trade with the West fell sharply in follow ing the collapse of the War the Soviet share of trade from the un usually low postwar figure of percent in to more than percent in It now that this trend been reversed and that the Soviet share in trade is We see little likelihood that Finland will so dependent upon trade with the Bloc as to impair further its ability to withstand unacceptable Soviet under comic We that Finland will continue to maintain the delicate bal position between East and West which it since the end of World War We believe it highly unlikely that the will attempt to invade Finland as a move in the global cold It is that the might at some time in the future use or be by some development such as West German armament to invoke its Mutual Assistance Pact with and per to demand additional radar or other In these the would probably feel to yield to such as did not seriously impair their national index The armed could delay only briefly a Soviet invasion of the coin the political temper of the people is such that Soviet occur nation

that their country a position of great strategic importance to the and that it cannot successfully defend itself against So For this reason Finland been obliged an official policy of strict real with

increase moderately during the next At the same the modernization of forest which is already under way with the help of from the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development will de crease

POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT Current Situation Since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic in the reduced its overt control much anime in East and enhanced the apparent independence of the local These appointment of a civilian High Commissioner in May have been intended to parallel in West and to give the the appearance of equality with the Federal Re public as a spokesman for German The East German regime remains less under effective Soviet control with respect to all its major and The Socialist Unity Party a monopoly of key government and is the principal instrument of Soviet Although its mass membership many opportunity and unreliable its top leadership is composed of Communist long in Soviet We believe that the can with its present count on the continued subservience of a native regime in East The other East German political are puppet which are main for and as a of indirect list of the Their mem are small and their funds are in part by the They have no capability for independent political Authority The popular support which the East Ger man regime is probably limited to its immediate in the and a of the for a reunification of contain with the and the low scale of living combine to keep the vast majority of the population Despite the re current to improve economic it is unlikely that any large part of the East German population can be won to support of the Communist On the other a widely organized re capable of effective opposition to the regime does not The open resistance which broke out on June was largely Active in the have since been subjected to a brutal suppression by the police and the The security police which is under close Soviet is probably capable of and breaking up any subversive organization extensive enough to constitute a danger the The knowledge that Soviet can and would be used to enforce the authority of the regime if necessary an important deter rent to new of mass if Soviet were we do not believe that the security of the East German regime could be upon to control of mass to Probable So long as the still to prevent the armament of West in alliance with the internal policy in East Ger many will be by re later to the contest for as a The new emphasis on living stand rather than on the rapid sovietization of the economy is likely to continue for the to the other the percentage of devoted to total in investment will

truce in the campaign against the will probably be although some pressure on the will be The relaxation of over internal will probably continue although police vigilance against the organization of resistance and against will be main We do not believe that any substantial withdrawal of Soviet from East Ger many is likely during the period of this The Kremlin might believe that with draw of some of its would lend sup port to its present tactics toward the Western that to appear to reduce the threat of war while holding out the prospect of neo as an alternative to armed a small part of present Soviet in East would suffice to support the internal security the a major withdrawal of Soviet would endanger other important Soviet and in East If West German armament is there is unlikely to be any reduction of Soviet in East and there may be an effort to accelerate the present of East German The latter might be by economic and concern for the reliability of such If a military likely to cause economic or an expansion in forced the East German re might seal off East from West and West Berlin by more vigorous than any The might also take in the direct of a provisional peace settlement and the association of the with the mutual assistance of the Bloc ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Current Situation In East is about half as large as West its population is about that of West its industrial are and its agricultural about those of West Since the For of this East Berlin Is Included In East except for been largely on the Soviet About percent of its all heavy been and the entire economy is directed by state The characteristic of the Soviet sacrifice of of living to to force rapid industrial have been Postwar economic recovery been although the gains have tagged con miserably behind those in West Ger Industrial production did not reach the level until and was at percent of that level in agricultural output still tagged about per cent behind Meanwhile population by Low product activity and Soviet in the form of re and occupation have kept the scale of living more than percent below prewar The forced assimilation of East into the economy of the Soviet Bloc been marked by a shift in foreign trade from the West to the Although in East Ger in accordance with the prewar still almost percent of its total trade with the at present more than of its trade is with Soviet Bloc Trade with West West fallen to less than percent of total for sign At the same the compose of trade been in an effort to obtain a maximum contribution to East Ger man and Bloc industrial In under the slogan of

harsh of the preceding year and a reduction in the rate of investment in heavy industry as well as an increase in the product of consumer Private trade and industry were and the pressure on private

recently been that some restrictive are being for call for a reduction of investment in heavy industry and for increasing investment in light industry and energy East German to the Soviet Bloc Soviet from the East German economy have probably close to two billion annually in occupation in and from German by the the Soviet East German agreement of August pro video for termination of reduction of occupation and the return to German ownership of by the at the end of the If this agree is the Soviet will be reduced from about to about percent of the gross This easing of the Soviet burden wolf

as a productive factor in the Even at the East German my that of the other in total output and in ratio of in industrial production to total In the East German is to have seated about percent of the Bloc and to have about percent of the So The value of the East German economy to the Bloc is even more significant in qualitative than in quantitative for East German to Bloc are concentrated in in industrial goods which support Bloc of industrial Thus in the ma construction industry about of these about and electrical en engineering and precision equipment about in certain of the key in these

energy program could probably be from elsewhere in the the will almost certainly wish to continue its rapid and extraction of uranium from East in order to accumulate maximum within the of the For the period of this uranium extraction will al most certainly continue at least on its present It is probable that the Soviet termination of and the return of printed represent a decision to re due the immediate of East German to Soviet use in the interest of the of the East German Since such a policy in many that being in other Bloc and is with the appear Soviet intention to retain East as a member of the we believe that the made in the Ger man agreement of August will be largely Although occupation and the cost to the East German state of the ura mining will still constitute a heavy it is that the economy can maintain an annual rate of growth of about percent during the period of this The of continued in the scale of living connection with the could be made good in consider enable degree

state and direction been given to scientific effort by the East German Academy of Science and the State there continued to be a severe shortage of scion and in part as a consequence of defection to

During the last five August to recruiting for all the at the rate of about men per As a the present strength of about border naval air is actually greater than that of June We believe that a gradual increase in the strength and combat effectiveness of the East German will political and the amount of which the regime can make available under its economic will continue to be limiting These could play only a limited combat role and would probably be assigned to support security Ground Police is organized into two corps and a Berlin Area The latter of one division and headquarters Each corps is

PROBLEM To estimate the current status and future course of the Soviet atomic energy program on the basis of information available from all SUMMARY While the exact extent of the Soviet capability for

from the equivalent of a few thousand to at least a million of In the Chief Directorate to the Council w was organized plan and carry out the atomic energy The first Soviet reactor capable of quantity production of plutonium probably went into operation during and by the spring and summer of the level of total reactor power thus marking the date of the start of production scale for the manufacture of The production of apparently tagged behind the plutonium program this was or the of technical is not as oily meager evidence is available that is relevant to the isotope separation phase of the The have a capability to accomplish independent research essential to their atomic energy While it is no doubt true that espionage German technical and unclassified scientific and technical literature available in made substantial to Soviet independent research by the to adapt to their needs the information through such was apparently carried out with a high degree of The evidence is now clear that in a number of Soviet atomic energy do not follow those of the the or Authority H u e It is that the total cumulative production of uranium metal available to the Soviet Union from East German production alone up to the end of was between and thousand It is possible that an equal amount could have been produced from internal and other Satellite The are for the most on very In the major portion of the of uranium is derived from which probably average between and Only a vast amount of hand can account for the large Comparable of ore are probably being extensively worked inside the It is that the probable total reactor power were in the neighborhood of during the period from early to the end of it is the total will increase during the period of this reaching a approximately to in It should be noted this increase is not intended to define the maximum capability for expansion of Soviet plutonium The absence of sufficient evidence from which to estimate or isotope separation capacity to be one of the most serious in intelligence information on the Soviet atomic energy It is that there are several possible of action the have taken with respect to production which are consistent with available evidence and which yield general guide for the Soviet An average value been taken for the purpose calculating the No evidence is available on Soviet with respect to power of atomic energy other than possible from Soviet interest in thorium and the high irradiation level of the plutonium in the together with research on of plutonium and some effort Will undoubtedly on

more This estimate will consider only those Bloc economic designed Improve the political position in the Increase the dependence of on Bloc Weaken support for on of strategic goods to the and Weaken the economic strength of the The economic warfare of the Soviet Bloc lie primarily in its ability to weaken the political cohesion within the world to increase actual in and to cut off trade where it been built The Soviet Bloc very limited for undermining the economic or strength of the world by goods and be cause the world from the Soviet Bloc only a very small range and quantity of Denial of these goods would have a negligible The Communist North and the Eastern effect on the economic and none on its military trade could be by the Bloc to create the impression that its peaceful and that

Bloc of even if not resulting in any considerable increase of could be used to dis satisfaction of some Authority with the export control system and even to weaken the system The Bloc could almost certainly ex and its external trade two or three times the level without mark regarding its progress toward self Such an increase in the vol ume of trade could easily be made acceptable to the world

at no net economic cost to the We do not that the Bloc will under take economic warfare involve ing a large scale increase in total external trade since a large expansion of external trade would

make extensive of currency or gold price or commodity as economic warfare There are many for Bloc economic warfare economic aid and the Bloc will probably make further of assistance to where it would expect to obtain the maximum propaganda from such assist It is that the Bloc will carry out substantial of this type except on a selective Soviet Bloc economic warfare could be effectively without

Of TRA Trade is potentially the most important instrument of economic warfare available to the It is for the Bloc to wage economic warfare of serious pro against the world solely by shutting off Bloc of since the world does not depend upon the Bloc for such Economic warfare through trade must there fore be by the Bloc mainly in three by offering to engage in trade with certain by building trade with certain non Communist to such a level as to create a of dependence upon the contain nation of that and by off or by threatening to cut off trade with non Communist By these the Bloc may seek to achieve such as weakening of export and reducing support for Western defense By increasing or promising to increase the Bloc might also in certain and especially in certain encourage more favorable political and enhance the influence of local See Economic Effects of Authority Where trade in the establishment of permanent Bloc trade in these could be used for of The Bloc recently made several at

Communist China which may result in some of and report is trade with both Communist and the Finally Communist China can apply some economic pressure on the Up by its trade with Hong Japan an important target for Bloc economic warfare by of Many look upon trade with the Bloc as a palace for their current and prospective economic and as an essential to the development of a satisfy tory political position in These are based on what we believe to be of the of expanding trade with the We do not believe that annual trade with Communist even with the removal of present and with an intensive trade promotion effort on the part of the could amount to more than million each This would produce a increase in current level of total Trade on this scale would by no be a but it would contribute substantially toward easing economic More concrete and Communist trade to Japan can be to increase agitation in Japan for the relaxation and ultimate removal of on trade with the Soviet Such would almost certainly strengthen neutrality Japan and those that are determined to assert independent position in respect to world Some of the other Southeast count would be for Bloc economic war fare

indigenous Communist in the DISCUSSION COMMUNIST Of ACTION In The chief which shape Communist policy in appear to the nature of the relationship between the and the other Communist and in particularly Communist Comma list in must of the of the Communist estimate of Up in Communist The does not appear to exercise over the various must and in the also lute control that it does over the Communist and The role of Communist China in the inter national Communist movement is markedly different from that of any other Communist Communist China the as the leader of the world Communist movement and generally responsive to the Soviet strategic and doctrinal but it is more an ally than a patel lite of the It some for independent action and probably an important influence upon the shaping of must policy the Far In the prestige Mao by the as a Communist theoretical in his own right goes far beyond that any other contemporary Although there is little specific we believe that Communist China is presently being a though still not status within the partner The gone further than ever in pushing claim to an acknowledged position in the Soviet Union given evidence of a willingness to have assume greater In communist in late information about and direction of Communist m The main of policy are probably jointly by and with the Soviet voice presumably being the dominant How the to treat Keeping with deference and is probably reluctant to over ride strongly must China to have an increasingly important role in the execution of Communist policy in North and Else where in the administration of Comma list does not appear to follow a con sister The of individual appear to be directed through various but for the most part either through or the of the separate do not always appear to be with each and there have been nationalism and dissident at times within the Communist in The Communist China appear to have the following common in As part of the general objective of ad dancing the world Communist to reduce and eventually eliminate Western power and influence from and to expand Communist power and To the Communist military potential in To increase the Communist Bloc comic potential by the of Communist China and North and To prevent the resurgence of an armed and hostile In the and Communist China probably have individual in The probably to sup plant Western power and influence in with Soviet power and to stab list and extend control over Communist within these to increase Communist military and economic and to extend and intensify Soviet control over Communist elsewhere in and Communist China to consolidate its revolution and develop a strong industrial base and a military stab and for this purpose to obtain greater Soviet to thwart any of the to interfere in Comma list internal to minimize Soviet influence in the border to increase Communist influence over Communist in the Far and to gain an acknowledged and index pendant position as a world power and as the leader of The respective of the and Communist China are in some conflict and constitute potential of between the two we believe that throughout the period of this estimate the cohesive in the relationship will be far greater than the divisive The and Communist China share a common Both of them regard the Up as the chief obstacle to their in and believe that their are by Up policy power in the each partner at the present time from its alliance with the Communist China considerable Soviet and economic support and The in China a valuable ally which not only military strength and de in depth in the Far but also a base for further advancing Communist in the alliance with Communist China the to use the as a political and psychological asset of great value in dividing and the We believe that the and Communist China will remain closely allied at least ing the period of this and that their in Communist object times in will not be reduced by friction or conflicting Communist Although the Keeping regime apparently lost much Authority its of its initial popular it firm control over the territory which it Communist involvement in a there is little likelihood of this control being or shaken by tic within the period of this The regime made considerable progress in economic rehabilitation and It now a large military by at is modern and Communist China still a period of building up its military and economic strength before it the position Communist military continue to be limited almost total dependence upon the for aircraft and heavy military in and particularly with respect to its naval and air and little or no experience in certain important of military tactical air sup high altitude amphibious and submarine and antisubmarine the period of relatively rapid economic recovery and development in Communist China to be coming to a and future gains will probably be some what The Keeping regime cur tailed the original scope of its ambitious Five Year economic apparently because must have a clearer and more sober appreciation of the many to be overcome in the rapid industrialization of Communist In the level of Soviet economic assistance is apparently not so high as Keeping originally Despite these limiting Communist military strength and effectiveness are far greater than those of any must state in and Communist to wage political warfare in and to support move in that

the chief factor in policy in is the probable role of the The almost believe that the Up to see Communism from and is determined to oppose fur Communist expansion in They j Authority may also estimate that the Up to take a more active part in an attempt to overthrow Communist The base these the presence of Up and bases in the and the Up public with respect to Comma aggression against or Communist aggression in Up defense with the and the Up military and diplomatic support of the Nationalist Government on Tai Up military assistance to and Up generally to increase the strength of the the probably further estimate that the Up is reluctant to become more deeply engaged in The might base this estimate the fact that Up did not expand the war and accepted an armistice in the intention of the Up to disengage a portion of its strength from as part of a new global and the apparent desire of the Up to avoid further aggravating exist ing with its allies over We believe that the and Comma list China have probably on the pass of the above military agree son against the or the by Communist would almost certainly bring Up against the possibly in with nuclear Communist military aggression against would probably result in such Up Communist mile try aggression elsewhere in would at least risk such Up and the Up is not to attack the The and Communist China cannot disregard the possibility that the Up might commit Up in to vent a decisive the and Communist China have probably that the Up will find it difficult in many to bring effective counter action to bear against Communist subversion in and that they therefore have a large area of maneuver open to them in in which to pursue of action which will provoke neither unacceptable nor effective Net effect of list of Action in We believe that the net effect of all the considered in the preceding will simple must to seek to attain their object times in through of action which will place heavy strain at this time upon the

that during the period of this estimate they are unlikely to obtain an settlement on their but that the present situation in both within the Western alliance and between and the which can be to must

program of the char after and magnitude in the and does not isolate the specific effects of control of particular COP By of con is meant the elimination of em cargo and quantitative on ship to the Soviet Bloc of all goods except the upon which a complete embargo will be arms and war equipment as defined in the international atomic energy and equip a limited number of electronic equipment and incorporate advanced technology and unique fast merchant and certain specialized of a few such as and nickel of which a great pro portion of the total world supply is pro used in the Free and industrial and selected Present on trade with Communist China would be The would not impose more string gent on trade with the Bloc than its allies Any approach to the problem of World trade must be made in the of the estimate of and conclude in sub that there is no sign that the ideological dynamic of the Communist regime is that the funds mental hostility of the Communist toward the Free World remains un and that their basic Authority times continue to be an expansion of their own sphere of power and the eventual domination of the have almost certainly reduced Bloc needs for the of goods which would be Communist and in the field must be re garden as designed primarily for the ad advancement of their basic One of is the promotion of within the Bloc trade are only in part by the normal trade of non Communist export have the development of Bloc comic and military The volume of trade between the Soviet Bloc and the word declined by about percent since This decline been partly by export It also been in by Bloc of and integration of the into the Bloc trading The relaxation of con on trade with the Soviet Bloc would probably produce an increase in Bloc of on the order of billion an but the volume of such might for a year or two range as high as one billion a Relaxation of trade would increase Bloc economic the effect would probably not be significant be The increase in Bloc would be small relative to Bloc out and Bloc to trade and general Bloc progress toward under The assumed program or relaxation of would improve the state There almost certainly various bottleneck in the Bloc economy which would be relieved by the import of the assumed to be demon Certain would be In these ways the Bloc economy would gain from the demon since we estimate that the assumed relaxation of would not significantly increase the total Bloc output of goods and and would be unlikely to increase the of that output devoted to military product or the increase in total Bloc military potential would almost certainly be Certain strategic gains would to the Bloc from a relaxation of non Communist export particularly in the short period following control Director of Naval the Assistant Chief of Department of the and the Deputy Director for The believe that the last sentence of Con inclusion should be as since we estimate that the as relaxation of would not sig increase the total Bloc output of goods and and would be to Increase the proportion that output de to production or the in crease total Bloc potential would probably be small on a quantitative this increase resulting from the assumed relaxation could provide significantly important to Bloc military It must be borne in mind that under any system of trade there Is always danger that individual capable of strategic advantage may be by the This danger might be by relaxation of con Q civil Authority Their value to the Soviet Bloc would be if Bloc anticipate the outbreak of general war in the near fu Over the long run military would be somewhat enhanced by the slightly higher rate of economic development and the greater flexibility which a relaxation of trade would make trade with the Bloc cone quest upon relaxation of would have no significant direct economic effect on the Up and only a modest comic effect on the some Western would anticipate significant economic expansion of trade with the It is improbable that such trade as is likely to result from the relaxation of export would have any significant effect upon the military potential of the The relaxation of con on trade with the Soviet the Far would considerably reduce the effective ness of on trade with Communist In this maintenance of these would cause resentment in the must with economic in in trade with particularly The of most in the ex port system now believe that the effect of present on Soviet Bloc power is disproportionately small in re nation to the domestic political and the loss of trade which these The present a growing source of irritation and patience with Up leadership and of between other relative stringent of and If are as at dimension over them will contribute to the runner ability of certain count for

DISCUSSION EFFECT Of EXPORT THE SOVIET export which have been progressively since March have had some effect in regarding the Soviet economic development and the growth of Bloc military Both of these effects have been in to the burden of the economic forced upon the Bloc by deprivation of of strategic The strain involved in affecting these was in the period immediately following the of and though in Growth of Bloc mile try potential been also directly by upon the export of list arms and war on arms and war equipment would not be by the program of control assumed in this It is probable that by this time the Bloc carried out extensive to the imposition of export by scarce from tale less strategic by f Authority and by providing new capacity for production of formerly even after such have been it probably still the Bloc more to produce most of the than it would to purchase them in the of the non Communist The de sire for certain by the non Communist export control system is clearly by the elaborate and costly by which the Bloc to import these By the Bloc at least until itself to expand its of consumer goods and other uncontrolled It is that list export have the level comment of Bloc and military The problem Is to determine how the economic and military power would be enhanced by the assumed relaxation of con as well as to determine the effects of such a control upon the cohesion and strength of the EVE AND PATTERN Of TRA BETWEEN THE AND THE WORLD In THE Of A TON Of TRA The Soviet Bloc The volume of trade between the mean Soviet Bloc and the world declined by about percent since This decline been partly by export It also been in by the Bloc of and integration of the into the Bloc trading It is unlikely that the Kremlin would make any important modification of these basic as a consequence of the relaxation of trade The Soviet Bloc would probably not seek to re some the importation of at the level and pattern of the period lately preceding the imposition of We have Bloc could almost certainly expand its external trade two or three times the level without markedly regarding its progress toward Most of the goods that the Bloc is currently and legally are probably important enough to the Bloc so that their importation would continue even after presently avail Hence the removal of would almost certainly result in an increase in the total volume and value of Bloc importation from the simply in a substitution of new for those presently To the extent that the of the Bloc to maintain or to Increase trade with the world have in the past been determined by the economic warfare objective of fostering dimension in over export con the relaxation of would reduce the vigor of such of on trade with the Soviet Bloc would permit Comma list China to obtain the via Bloc Communist China would thereby be to obtain from which it cannot now import from such and which the Soviet Bloc is un willing or unable to supply in adequate quan The extent to which Communist China could obtain additional in this man would depend on of the Kremlin which would be affected by of general as well as by the ability of the Soviet Bloc to obtain from must the increase in trade between the Bloc and the non Communist world might also enable Comma list China to develop additional out in through Eu open Bloc and thus increase must ability to pay for These could not be by present on shipping and in connection with trade with must and would be if the relaxation of on trade with the See IE Bloc Economic and of March paragraph Authority mean Soviet Bloc were to make list more freely available for sale to Bloc The World Under short of war or the mediate threat of it is likely that expand ing capacity in the world will result in increasing pressure to find goods of the type which would In he There will be enough l comic slack in most even in the absence of to in them in to the Ability to supply additional on a con winning basis may be In the event of a significant contraction of total demand in the the to find market in the Bloc would increase Effect of Relaxation of upon the level and Pattern of T rode If the Soviet Bloc to the assumed relaxation of trade by the importation of at the upward in proportion to the growth of the Bloc economy since the annual volume of Bloc trade with the world would probably undergo an increase on the order of This calculation can only be taken as a rough guide to the of relaxation of On the one Bloc to trade con and general Bloc progress toward under have almost certainly reduced Bloc needs for the cate of goods which would be On the other it is possible that the Bloc would take advantage of control to depart temporarily from its policy of re during in expectation of at higher of In this Bloc trade with the world for a year or exceed present by as much as In view of the time necessary for trade and a period of from two to three would pro able be before the effects of the relaxation of were It is also probable as a consequence a continue of Soviet Bloc Of self that there would subsequently be a decline in Bloc trade in relation to income and total world How the increase in Bloc would he distributed among the is impossible to It is probable that the Bloc would be particularly interested in in such cate as precision chemical electronic diesel en and The Bloc would probably also desire to import some of certain of ball and roller and high alloy certain of and specialized petroleum and possibly some of synthetic which it is likely to wish to import on a significant scale include copper and possibly The goods which the Bloc would be most likely to want to buy would have to come mainly from Western and the EFFECTS Of A RELAXATION Of TRA THE SOVIET Blue Economic The effect upon the Bloc economy of the assumed relaxation of trade and the resultant increase in trade with the world would depend upon the to which deprivation of the for control Bloc output and the extent to which free less to of these would stimulate the growth of Bloc output Although it is clear that the Bloc would bene fit from control of these the adjust made by the Bloc in response to the imposition of trade have gone suffix gently far to make the present importance for economic growth of of these less than it was at the time the were the effect the Bloc of a continuation of on the i E Q T Authority for control is the difference between what it now the Bloc of economic to procure those by all not only domestic production but also illegal and pay of premium and what those would cost if in list in the absence of control On this it is that an increase of to one billion in trade in the would result in a net comic gain to the Bloc of the order of to million a or about a quad to a half of percent of Bloc There are almost certainly various bottle in the Bloc economy which would be by the importation of the as to be Certain would be In these ways the Bloc economy would gain from the de control We believe it that such in individual of the Bloc economy as would result from the as importation after control would significantly modify the estimate of the con attribution to Bloc economic as stated in paragraph Strategic The Bloc would gain a strategic van page from a relaxation of ex port which cannot be adequately measured by the comparatively slight effect which such a relaxation would have on the growth of Bloc or on military expand If the increase in rate of growth of were disproportionately concentrated in the of military and the Bloc would get considerable strategic advantage from its access to We that the assumed program of relaxation of would not greatly advance the rate of growth of the military assuming to be effectively on the listed in the and specifically on bottleneck to military In the light of the various the of we believe that the assumed pro gram of relaxation of would probably not lead the Bloc to increase the proportion of its to military Since we estimate that the assumed relaxation of would not increase the total Bloc output of goods and and would be unlikely to increase the proportion of that output devoted to military production or the increase in total Bloc military po central would almost certainly be Certain strategic gains would to the Bloc from a relaxation of export particularly in the short period following decontroL The opportunity to build up strategic stockpile of such mate as copper and to acquire certain of machinery and and to build up its merchant would be par useful if the Bloc the outbreak of general war in the near Over the run Bloc military would be somewhat enhanced by the slightly higher rate of economic development and the greater flexibility which a relaxation of non Communist trade would make posse Political The relaxation of export as assumed would not significantly affect the political cohesion of the Soviet the continuation of The Director of Naval the Assistant Chief of Department of the and the Deputy Director for The Joint believe that the last sentence of paragraph should be as we estimate that assumed relax of would not in crease the total Bloc output or goods and and would be unlikely to Increase the proportion of that output devoted to military production or the Increase in total Bloc military potential would probably be small on a quantitative Qualitative this increase resulting from the assumed relax of could provide significantly important to Bloc military See of General War Through r I I l I I I I Authority present over trade with Communist China might occasion some friction between China and the if the Kremlin its monopolistic position as agent of While the Bloc would probably regard the relaxation of as in part removing an important target of psychological warfare in the non Communist Bloc propaganda would al most certainly attempt to portray the re taxation as a victory for the Communist Bloc economic although they would be quick to take van page of the to increase of scarce would nevertheless be to view the relaxation with suspicion and for some time after would be prepared for a reversal of trade The fundamental hostility of Bloc to the world would remain un EFFECTS Of A RELAXATION Of TRA THE COMMUNIST WORLD Economic The increase in trade between the non Communist world and the Soviet Bloc which would result from relaxation of trade would have only a modest economic effect on the In the next several such an increase in trade would be attractive to some Western Although the under ing economic position of most Western mean is now than at any time in the postwar Western is likely to have capacity in the and engineering These could readily supply the in crease in to the Soviet Bloc without to other Some Communist would also be but only trade with the Bloc would have no significant direct economic effect on the trade with the Bloc how offer for Western The Bloc could increase by about of a billion its present to of timber and other primary to from the dollar In addition the Bloc could sell gold to Western in the event of an import Although dollar are less important to Western than formerly because of the dollar position of the they may become of increasing significance after if us economic aid and extraordinary dollar ex drop these Most of the in the world stand to gain little such trade as is likely to result from the relaxation of trade and may actually suffer an economic loss as a result of such On the one the only strategic of party economic produced by which might be are copper and With control Bloc of these and certain other minor might amount to million per at the On the other the Bloc will seek to pay for its chiefly through of primary These by and large will compete with the of under in world and could press already weakening for such as wheat and man An increase of trade between list and the Bloc based on Bloc of if concern in certain of the list tend to establish a degree of economic dependence in those on the Bloc which the Bloc could exploit for comic warfare Strategic It is improbable that such trade as is likely result from the relaxation of export would have any significant effect upon the military potential of the must Relaxation of might See IE Bloc Warfare and or March Authority contribute to a of between the world and the Any significant relaxation of would pro able lead some to reduce their military Political The present international system of ex port at best lukewarm support in the world outside the The other of the

their effect upon Bloc economic and that military They consider these will not in the long run make an appreciable in Soviet Bloc relative to the of the non Communist They believe that in the short

strategic policy through THE PROBLEM We believe that the stability and authority of the Soviet regime will not be affected during the period of this estimate by for power or re spelling policy within the ruling Soviet authority over the will almost certainly remain There are potential of interest between the and Communist China but we believe that during the period of this mate the cohesive in the relation ship will be far greater than the divisive policy of the will probably continue to place primary em phases on the rapid development of heavy industry and war though with more attention than in the past to level comment of agricultural and consumer goods The high of comic growth in the immediate postwar have been We believe that the annual rate for the next two will be about or percent and in about or L believe that if current economic are carried on as Soviet defense will have to remain approximately constant in of pur chasing at least through military even if it does not rise above the high level in and in will be sufficient for continuous qualitative movement of the armed in weak and Apart from this general qualitative improve the most significant in Soviet military

present of policy throughout the period of this it should be borne in mind that the pro press being made by the in the development of nuclear and the increasing Soviet capability to deliver these are the world power situation in important Under these Soviet will almost certainly believe as Soviet nuclear the aversion of the Up and its allies to general war will correspondingly and that the Kremlin will therefore have greater free dom of action to pursue its without running substantial risk of gen real Thus the Kremlin will be in increasingly ready to apply heavy pressure on the world upon any of major dimension or weakness among the Up and its We that the Kremlin will continue to be extremely reluctant to precipitate a contest in which the would be sub to nuclear At the same we believe that the Kremlin would not be deferred by the risk of general war from taking against an action by the Up its allies which the Kremlin considered an imminent threat to Soviet We believe that the extent to which the Kremlin the in freedom of action which its in nuclear appear to give and the success which will depend primarily upon the determine and cohesiveness of the believe the Communist in general share these Soviet about the world situation and about and of advancing Communist During the period of this Communist China will probably be to undertake reluctant of action which it might

because of the possibility of between the Up and its Continued Communist in or the of present Communist gains in would probably lead the to expand to subvert neighboring by political infiltration and covert support of local though probably not by the commitment of identifiable combat of Communist armed The aggressiveness with which a policy would be would depend on the vigor and effectiveness of list DISCUSSION BASIC COMMUNIST AND The regime now in power in the or any that is likely to succeed almost mainly will continue for the indefinite future to consider its basic objective to be the con oxidation and expansion of its own In this internally and policy most Soviet probably the elimination of every world power center capable of with the the spread of Communism to all of the and Soviet domination over all other Communist Soviet probably are also to the following concerning the expansion of the power of the The struggle between the Communist and the is Director of that paragraph should read as believe that Communist in general share these Soviet about the world situation and about and of advancing Communist Communist China will probably not choose knowingly any course of action likely to expose its fundamental national in war with a major we believe that must strength for various of warfare are and the and judgment of its are such as to make Communist of action dangerously unpredictable under outside pressure of any reliable with one system eventually the This struggle may go on a long with of strategic retreat possibly in evening before the final Communist

its while trying to divide and weaken the SOVIET POLITICAL STRUCTURE AND THE STABILITY Of THE REGIME The regime to these basic be is by the small group of less than men in the Polite of the Central Committee of the must Most of this same group of in governmental men exercise authority through their in the Council of the formal seat of executive authority in the Their joint control over the apparatus of Soviet power is and the primacy of the to be enforced rigidly by elaborate and police The regime may exercise its police somewhat more moderately and Authority less arbitrarily than in the but this re strain would derive from conviction that the regime can best attain its domestic in this not from any fear of popular dis approval or any reluctance to use force if necessary to maintain government The most powerful Soviet leader to be member in both the Communist Party and the Council of Party First Secretary risen early since the elimination of and may now be on a level with neither nor nor any of the other Soviet is cur gently in a position as an individual to exercise power independently of the The party so thoroughly the security government and armed that independent action by any one of these at the command of an individual Soviet leader is nearly We therefore believe it most unlikely that any struggle for power among Soviet will lead to overt or widespread civil such a system of joint authority in a totalitarian society to be a balance of power among the various last for some really if most of them feel that their require its Now that power been successfully transferred after death and been efficiently disposed the Soviet regime may continue with some thing comparable to the current and for some may take place in the composition of the ruling group or in the relative power of its one man may even succeed in gaining absolute We do not that any significant disruption or weakening of the of Soviet power would accompany such in the of leading We believe that whatever for power or respecting policy may develop within the ruling group are unlikely during the period of this estimate to affect the stability of the regime or its authority within the we believe the regime will not be significantly in its ability to arrive at policy and carry them out These and their implementation will continue fleet the fundamental agreement

growth of the Soviet economy will be about or percent per and that in the period it will decline to about or percent per The higher rate of growth in the near term is to suit from the resumption of a high rate of increase in total investment in the traditionally lagging of and goods On the other the rate of growth in the period will be somewhat in part because of a decline in the growth of the labor force ing from the low birth rate during World War Even the average annual growth rate for the entire period of this estimate will be nearly double the average annual increase in of the Up

traditional Soviet rapidly after than in the economic policy of primary emphasis In the rate of growth of SECRET Authority on the rapid development of heavy industry and war The new regime how devoted a great deal of its attention and to a revision of current economic at speeding up the production of agricultural especially food and Soviet have stated that this goal is to be without decreasing the tempo of heavy industrial but they patently at least for the next two not to increase defense above the high level in and in This modification of Soviet economic is designed to overcome the lag in the growth of certain of the particularly and to bring about a better balanced over the long The promise of Soviet to increase the volume of goods is being by a serious effort to fulfill or early exceed the in the Plan as set forth in If the regime would thus reverse the persistent trend of recent whereby this sector of the Soviet economy slipped well below as a result of the priority in the of economic to heavy industry and defense The heart of the new economic program is the effort to increase output providing greater to the peasant population in the form of goods and channeling greater capital investment to agriculture in the form of mechanical draft machine and building pro riding the with an ample supply of improving farm qualified organization and and under cultivation vast of semiarid virgin land in the eastern and central concern of the Soviet regime is that the inadequate of agricultural product been a critical factor in the slowdown in the rate of growth of Soviet industrial labor The Soviet Union been getting more and more out of its industrial labor force each but the annual are getting smaller and The new economic program at increasing the urban supply of food and other consumer goods with this incentive for industrial steadily raising the level of labor productivity in Soviet The new agricultural program of greater times and investment may mark the first step along of economic development that Soviet will find it advisable to pur sue for a number of They will almost certainly continue them through and in view of the likelihood that will fall far short of plan they may continue them during the whole period We believe that agricultural production is unlikely with normal to in crease by more than about percent annually during the period making a total increase of percent for the whole period as with the original Plan goal of about percent in crease for the period Even the annual increment to the total Soviet gross national product will be large enough to per moderate in of living and greater investment in product ing goods without heavy industrial growth or the maintenance of a high level of military EFFECT Of ECONOMIC PROGRAM Of SOVIET that if the new economic pro gram is carried on as Soviet defense expenditure will have to remain lately constant in of at least through by the pat tern of budgetary Soviet annual defense expenditure for will be the same as for approximately whereas it more than percent between and We believe that So defense of all in to about to percent of total Soviet and that the proportion will slightly diminish for at least two or three and possibly through In any war potential will steadily in the crease as a result of the growth of Authority SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL Of THE SOVIET Soviet

consider it probable that before inter evening in the would have accepted the likelihood of Up air against military in they would not feel to withdraw their from solely as a result of the initiation of the air opera assumed At the same we In this requirement we interpret ly Communist military to be generally south of the River and to consist primarily of transport troop con and air the believe

which would preserve the Communist position and in Meanwhile the to the full extent of their would prosecute the war on the ground in and attack allied air aircraft and other directly supporting allied in the They probably try to keep the war tired in as a probably would confine their to such directly supporting bases and The use of nuclear under the given above would greatly in crease Communist concern about Up but probably not by itself cause them to adopt new of military action at this they would threaten nuclear They would also exploit to the resultant logical and in particular would Authority that the Up was of destruction on the civilian The would attempt all possible to convince other that the us had to story the Communist regime in order to thwart its on behalf of an

military assistance to Communist especially aircraft and small naval silly with Soviet per sonnet to train and advise the and probably to participate in air defense opera The would probably not openly commit combat of the Soviet armed and probably would not release nuclear for Communist The Kremlin would also continue its and propaganda against the undertaking in the Up to brand the Up as an

This risk would be less a function of Up for physical detection then of the scope and complexity of the clandestine particularly into far as of Soviet Considering the of a breach of the would probably

higher che of the Communist Party and would not lead to civil or of major The appearance of new leadership in had no apparent effect on the character of between the and its Satellite in Eastern We believe that Soviet authority over the Satellite will remain intact ing the period of this Communist China is more an ally than a Satellite of the It some capability for independent posse by even for action which the might disapprove but which it would find cult to We believe that de spite potential of friction between the two from occasional of national the code in the relationship will be far greater than the divisive through out the period of this Economic The rate of growth of the Soviet my declined in the past five from the very high rate of the immediate postwar We estimate that during the next two Soviet gross national product will increase by about or and in by about If Up or per should increase during the period of this estimate at its annual average of Soviet would at the end of the period be about of as with about in The pattern of resource allocation in the Soviet economy in about percent devoted to percent to and percent to con economic indicate that for at least the next two the amount of expenditure on de instead of the rapid in crease that in will remain about the while expand true on investment and consumption will We believe the are better than even that the Kremlin will continue its along these throughout the period of this The chief emphasis will almost certainly continue to be on further development of heavy The chief weakness of the Soviet my as a whole been in agricultural which since at approximately the prewar though the population is now about percent greater than in Soviet appear to have that continuation of the serious lag in true would ultimately make it difficult to meet the food of the grow ing urban the raw material of the expanding industrial and the export of Soviet foreign in which agriculture a major To remedy the the regime on a vigorous with the aim of a by a percent increase in agricultural production over We believe that this goal will not be and that even in agricultural production will be no more than to percent

from of which in its judgment would clearly Authority solve substantial risk of general believe that as Soviet nuclear the or one of the Bloc the unwillingness of the and particularly of its to risk general might take action a situation in which the Up or its war will correspondingly and that the Kremlin will therefore have rather than yield an important greater freedom of action to promote its

to apply heavy pressure on the the risk of general war from taking contraction against a Western action must world upon any of major dimension or weakness among the Up and which it considered an imminent threat its we believe that to Soviet Thus general war the Kremlin will be extremely reluctant might occur during the this to precipitate a contest in which the mate as the climax of a series of and by either would expect to be subjected to nuclear The extent to which the which neither side originally to lead to general Kremlin its increasing freedom of action will depend primarily on the de The progress being made by the and cohesiveness in the development of nuclear of the and the increasing Soviet capability to deliver these are the world power situation in important re Soviet almost certainly The Assistant Chief of and the Direct tor of believe that the losing should be substituted for the first sen hence of paragraph the Kremlin will probably try to a void of action and to deter Communist China from of action that entry substantial risk of the in general it may be more willing to support of action that would Involve risk of a war between the Up and must The support given such action would depend largely on Soviet judge as to the probable outcome of the If the Soviet that it would result In a severe defeat to or the full scale participation of the general they would probably exert pressure on the Chi nose to avoid of action which would precipitate On the other if they that the conflict could be lim item to war In the Far and that it would result greater relative damage to Up than to Communist they support more adventure probably would of action on the part of the We believe that the will to pursue its expansionism and to seek and exploit for enlarging the area of Communist It will be in its determination to retain the initiative in international and to capitalize on in order to keep the Free World on the de For the near the Kremlin will almost certainly continue to direct its external towards the immediate of weakening and the mutual defense arrange of prevent ing or regarding the armament of Ger many and undermining the comic and political stability of must and isolating the Up from its allies and in and At the same time it will continue to expand the industrial strength of the and to maintain large modern as a guarantee of the in integrity of the Bloc and as an instrument of intimidation in support of its The will vary the used to accomplish the foregoing and will time their so as to exploit that in their judgment offer the most favorable For the time the Kremlin to feel that its foreign will be best by a generally conciliatory pose in foreign by of and for mu dual security by tempting of and by on of peace and The purpose of these is to ally fear in some of the to create the impression that there been a basic change in Soviet and there by to destroy the incentive for Western defense and to undermine Up At the same the continue to support and encourage na nationalist and and to maintain their effort to subvert outside the We believe that the Kremlin will revert to more aggressive and threatening conduct when ever it that such conduct will bring By such and of tactics the Soviet almost certainly consider that they can improve the for further Comma must strategic We do not believe that such tactics indicate any change in basic Communist or that they will involve any substantial on the part of the We believe that Southeast in the Communist the most favor able for expansion in the near The will at tempo to extend their gains in and will expand their to intimidate and subvert neighboring by po political infiltration and covert support of local We do not believe that the will attempt to se cure

force grew less rapidly after than in the In the rate of growth of Soviet in was reduced as a result of the by the of economic in that We estimate that in the next two the rate of growth of the Soviet economy will be about or percent per and in the period about or percent per The higher rate of growth in the next two is to result from the resumption of a high rate of increase in total additional investment in the traditionally lagging of the economy agriculture and consumer goods On the other the rate of growth in the period will be some what due mainly to a decline in the rate of growth of industrial Even the average annual growth rate for the entire period will be nearly double the average annual increase in of the Up economy of and substantially above the annual increase of just over

station will change appreciable during the period of this During the number of available for new mile try classes should increase somewhat over those available in the preceding three because of the entry into the military age group of several classes unaffected by during the period of agricultural The male population of military age will probably increase in these as a result of these new and because or the movement out of this group of a male population by World War Be teen and the number of available for new military classes and the number of new entering the labor force will increase

official Soviet which an increase in the agricultural labor force through the position of Soviet agriculture to have deter rated somewhat between and Con the regime was to direct skilled labor back to the countryside in The nonagricultural labor force will grow much less rapidly during the period of this estimate than in the preceding five as the result of several the most import ant of which the new agricultural will require a increase in the agricultural than in the nonagricultural labor force in thus reversing temporarily the the amount of labor transferred from rural to urban work will be limited by the availability of housing in urban and the low birth rate during World War In will reduce the number SECRET of new into the labor force after New into the labor force are to decline from

Total Scale of Living The scale of living of the Soviet as a whole risen steadily since the end of the and in certain the living scale of large of the urban population is somewhat higher now than in the immediate prewar The increase in supply of consumer goods to urban although far greater for than for been principally re possible for the rise in per available in the postwar since there been a steady rise in the per real income of the urban population as a result primarily of successive annual price By urban per real income probably the level by some but was still somewhat below the On the other postwar construction and restoration of de spite a rise to percent of total investment as with the prewar still barely kept pace with the growth of the urban now more than Per urban dwelling space is still only about equal to the miserably low prewar The gains made by urban in the postwar period have not been in the Soviet which more than half the Soviet Oppressive agricultural taxation and procurement have the regime to collect an in share of agricultural for urban even though agricultural pro auction did not rise appreciable between the prewar and postwar and actually de lined in several of These depressed the position of the rural population and to the de deterioration in the quality and size of the cultural labor The current program to increase the sup ply of consumer goods

that a serious effort is also being made to raise living in the country The general improvement in the mater ai welfare of the population will still leave the scale of living in the by the end of the period far below that of most of Western both the better living and the hope of further will probably tend to generate some improvement in morale among the Allocation for urban housing construct have

the past quarter century been by large in in industrial labor reflecting primary ly rapid technological progress and large in investment in plant and lately after World War In productivity in with

series of organizational and iterative designed to increase man aerial efficiency have been The of industrial and their sub ordinate over resource utilization have been and greater responsibility been given to local These were probably intended to increase man aerial initiative and efficiency at both central and local without actually relinquish ing control of the Soviet We believe it probable that

is most unlikely of achievement except under unusually favorable weather and that a yearly average of some to million metric with wide annual is more likely during the period of this On taking into account the pro gram for both old and new we believe that agricultural production is unlikely suing average to increase by more than about percent annually during the period making a total increase of to percent for the whole period as with the Five Year Plan goal of about a percent increase for the period even the to percent increase would be large enough to achieve a moderate rise in the per

military even at the would still per the maintenance of the Soviet armed at present high and would allow continuous qualitative improvement in weak ons and During the period of this estimate we

increase in the and of nuclear an increase in the ers of especially and an increase in the submarine progressive modernization and standardization of weak ons and particularly those incur electronic

The Soviet surface fleet during the period of this estimate will remain deficient in tal and almost certainly without air craft the Soviet line fleet is large and many craft of which a significant and increasing proportion are of Most of the major surface and all of the will probably be kept and the present rate of new construction will permit the creation of a sub spatial reserve It is that all such reserve or inactive could be act by The Soviet Naval Air approximately percent of the total strength of Soviet military is with jet aircraft of the fighter and light bomber as well as piston mine and and reconnaissance type This force is to For and personnel as well as see Appendix Tables and main approximately constant in strength throughout the period of this how jet will probably be Since light fleet de and all of postwar have been added to the Naval construction in the is presently at about which about Soviet and total Bloc and could be built in all fleet except the Far There are a few of the construction of a ship than a and such a vessel could become operational during the period of this that the We will place primary emphasis upon the construction of destroyer and long range

During the postwar period the bas and continually its large air Although in World War In the was giving primary emphasis to the ground support role of air in the post war period increasing attention

combat will probably continue to operate at about For of Bloc air aircraft and see Appendix Tables and See Appendix Table percent of capacity with a total output of about to In view of the factor of obsolescence and of the high re of the operating these of production are insufficient to permit any significant of aircraft and electronic Airfield development in the and the during the postwar period

that as of at least two of Soviet Aviation with a strength of aircraft were in process of equipment with Type jet medium Total actual strength of these in at imagery Series production of the Type is to have begun in and total production as of is at about It is that Soviet Aviation will contain an actual strength of jet medium by and by The Type which was initially on and later in flight on seven

throughout the period of this main ly through proficiency of flying per sonnet and quality of How since Communist China will probably not produce aircraft during the period of this effectiveness will

elaborate totalitarian the high ly regiment character of the to some the dispersal of and constitute strong of the we believe civil defense in the event of an air attack would be handicapped by a shortage of transport and MILITARY Of THE SOVIET General During the postwar period a rough bal of military power between the Soviet Bloc and the Soviet superiority in conventional being been generally offset by the Western possession of superior nuclear and economic Since the margin of Bloc numerical superiority in and conventional ground and air armament been On the other while still inferior in nu clear and delivery Soviet to overcome these de have greatly the The development of nuclear and of the ability to deliver such on target will probably in future be the most decisive factor in the relative military of the Communist Bloc and the Up During the period of this estimate Soviet in the use of nu clear will continue to At the highest capability for de living nuclear in open military attack by Soviet capable for nuclear attack by of from and will really in the latter part of this In the increasing Bloc capability to in interfere with the flow of and materiel from the us to its allies overseas will be an important factor in the relative military T Q P i C R F Authority of the Bloc and the Western coal provided there are no significant in present political we believe that a rough balance of military power between the Soviet Bloc and the West will continue during the period of this Offensive The core of Soviet offensive strength at present is an ability to mount against Western and the The could launch a surprise attack against West with the to Soviet ground now in East and By prior concentration of west of the almost certain loss of the could attack with to A to to could be accomplished by Air sup port for could come from the Soviet aircraft presently in East and the with available from the air craft in the Western Air of great weight and nuclear could be with little or no warning against any exposed in Western and the In any pain against Western we believe it unlikely that Satellite would be used except as security or to protect Soviet of community In a maximum operation the also the capability of well and trained in an assault against the Western of These could be in and could be to Rhine river crossing and nearby military install by aircraft bases

purpose pow red pilotless aircraft with a mum range of nautical and a war head of We believe that it will not be within Soviet capability within the No estimate of the success of the offensive in this

Japan and from they could reach in the Is In Soviet could reach all of the Stand and In the Far if from Soviet or North these could reach all of the and if from China they could reach all of In Soviet could reach Up North bases in in add to the listed During the period of this estimate Soviet offensive naval will still be limited to undersea surface in no than and air shore based naval air The Soviet submarine force will great ly increase its capability to undertake often and mining along most of the strategically situated sea and possibly to launch missile against on both the Atlantic and Pacific seaboard of the Major Soviet surface and naval aircraft will probably con to increase their capability to undertake offensive in Bloc coastal es specially in the Basic and Black and to protect the award flank of ground cam The Soviet Navy will almost certain ly have no amphibious capability within the period of this but it will remain capable of mounting am amphibious in considerable We estimate that the now a stock of over mines and the capability to employ them to interfere seriously with allied sea In the this effort could include all the and of the Up and Western Eu In the Far most of the vital allied port and sea around the perimeter of the Bloc could be similarly Air Defense We estimate that at present Bloc defend against air attack are client to provide an adequate

more effective than that THE SOVIET ESTIMATE Of THE WORLD STATION The Soviet view the world as an arena of conflict between the Communist and Soviet policy is there fore extremely sensitive to in world power and the Soviet current estimate of the intent and of the world is a decisive factor in the of action which the will pursue during the period of this Soviet Estimate of Soviet have long that the core of strength lay in the productive power of the Up and especially in its industrial They recognize that the Up is economically capable of supporting very powerful military in time of and of war for a longer period than any other major They also understand the economic power of the Up to be a great political giving the Up the capability of supporting and strengthening the military and political stab of its and at the same time of for political use through out the and of the They recognize the economic of the Up and its allies to be greatly superior to those of the and the but they almost believe that capitalist society will in the long run inevitably decay because of its own in here that the Up and its allies are incapable of this superiority The Soviet almost certainly be live that during the period of this estimate the world will such strength in major of military power that general war would involve not only the certainty of widespread destruction within the but the possibility of the of the Soviet system They almost certainly believe that the West and will maintain through superior naval strategic air greater nuclear and greater industrial they almost certainly believe that the increase of their own nuclear even if these remain inferior to those of the tend to qualify the significance of the Western The Soviet probably recognize that if the Up should use its nuclear capability to the maximum in the event of general the would be unable to prevent of major of the industrial and military strength of the Soviet They probably recognize that the possession by the Up of air bases the the West with an advantage which probably could not be entirely overcome even by sur rise upon these The Soviet almost believe that even if most of these bases were the Up by military or political action the Up would still be able to deliver severe against the Under the most optimistic the Soviet might believe that Up nu clear could be at least temporarily I Soviet Estimate of by political or by The probably that the threat of Soviet retaliatory power upon the Up will continue its development of overseas Up or its Under such the military and it probably this Soviet would probably estimate that development with genuine and profound fiction of Up These are present Western would be probably by such apparently client to prevent considerable initial Soviet tile as the disguised discussion the of in the Up press of the vulnerability of Soviet They would probably to air the that the Up that the war would not be ended with is nuclear at overseas these original and that grave danger would remain that the Up nuclear capability and the widely in Up defense policy would in the end be The Soviet retaliatory Many Up defensive probably that ing the period of this estimate Western probably appear to the Kremlin to will remain sufficient to make the be We believe the come of war extremely hazardous and the Up military base program a serious threat to its own but we uncertain for the also believe its estimate of the imminent of the threat will depend upon its view of the world political situation rather than upon the existence of the bases In the Soviet probably expect the Up to persist in its to obtain some that would bring a re armed West into alliance with the We believe that the Kremlin the prospect of a West closely allied with the as one of the most serious potential to Bloc The Kremlin almost certainly that the Up will agree to the unify cation of only if it is confident that a will not fall under must and probably only if it that will be linked with the The Soviet almost certainly be live that the Up to maintain in and will support with force its position in They clearly recognize the great political which the possession of West Berlin the and they almost certainly estimate that the Up would accept the risk of war rather than relinquish Berlin under Soviet the Kremlin may estimate that the other Western would be less dis than in to resist harassment of the Western position in especially if made to appear an East German rather than a Soviet Soviet probably estimate that the Up is unlikely deliberately to initiate general war during the next few They pro able that the Up would not be by fear of the of general from its full military if it that its security was imminent The Soviet almost certainly believe that the Up would consider as such a threat any overt armed aggression by Bloc against any country formally allied with the They probably also estimate that such aggression against a state not formally allied to the Up would in solve risk of Up military but that the degree of this and the of the Up would depend upon the importance to the Up of the country the of the and the polite cal situation within the Up and the must world Soviet almost certainly estimate that extensive Communist political warfare will be unlikely to provoke Up military and they probably believe that the Up would be unlikely to initiate general war against the even if the of political warfare should lead to the establishment of Communist govern in presently j i t t i i t i SECRET The Soviet estimate of Up in the Far East is probably less confident than that for any other area of the world at the present This uncertainty probably because of the conflicting manifesto title of opinion within the the apparent conflict of among the Western revealed during the and the apparent reluctance of the Up to adopt of action in the Far East which would the neutral of or alienate threaten the harmony of the Western all At the same the Soviet are aware of many by Up determination to resist the further expansion of Communism in the Far the defense of and the the Soviet probably believe that the Up will seek to avoid of action carrying grave risk of general war or seriously its but will at tempo to prevent the consolidation of present Communist gains and to resist further must they almost certainly estimate that the Up will attempt to bring the of Western and na into harmony with those of the Up ing the period of this estimate and will push forward with the development of an defense arrangement similar to Soviet Estimate of In the Kremlin the ability of the Western to give effect to their intent during the period of this estimate will be limited by a number of political and comic which will operate to weaken the Western alliance and undermine its The below are probably those which the Soviet be live constitute the principal of the Fear of Nuclear The Soviet probably calculate that increasing Soviet nuclear will have a grow ing influence on the of list They probably estimate that no government will willingly run grave of war unless are at stake which it con sides and that the threat of nuclear will almost certainly tend to narrow the range of that any government will consider They apparently estimate that the temper of world opinion is such that latent in the world can be to encourage neutrality sent shake confidence in the and maturity of Up and un determine Up ability to lead the list the Soviet probably estimate that growing aversion to general war with nuclear will cause both the Up and its allies to show increasing concern to deal with local aggression without to which might lead to general The Kremlin probably that may arise in certain local to employ limited military action with out running serious risk of general Political of interest and policy among are pro able by the Soviet to hamper Up to maintain an effective alliance during the period of this They apparently believe the following are particularly the problem of German of trade Far Eastern the issue of recognition of Communist of nuclear In the long apparently that of attitude toward these and re later will produce schism among The Soviet probably estimate that and social economic and political will re main the most serious to the build ing of a strong and stable They probably estimate also that the may continue to veto West armament and admission to the Western and that as a result the Government may its presently strong modify Even the which on son may be calculated by the Kremlin to carry the P A Authority ability of future estrangement between two in the list The Soviet probably estimate that serious among will continue over in the Far and they probably hope that these over the next few will result in an increasing isolation of the Up from the other of the They almost certainly believe that the army stick in Communist for further further un declined Western prestige in and weak end Western to mobilize local to On the other opposition hand they probably recognize the chance that a too aggressive Communist policy in might tend to catalyst resistance in the non Communist of and contribute to the development of a strong list alliance in the In any the Kremlin probably that the Up will continue to face complex during the period of this in its in the Far East with those of its allies and the of Economic The Soviet probably expect economic to assume greater prominence during the period of this and to test the strength and lesion of the Western They profess to believe that the capitalist economy is afflicted by a deepening and irremediable In the Communist state that the capitalist world market been fatally by the expansion of the Communist and that the re emergence of and Japan will pro due critical of economic and Nationalism in Un The Soviet have long that in the under of the world constitute for the They probably believe that in some of the Middle and Southeast must are enhanced by cal economic and social inadequate material and technological resentment of Western and extreme The are aware that these are undergoing a social and economic revolution which is con drive to political The Kremlin probably that Up economic aid and military assistance will not wholly overcome and that for the encouragement of will continue to be Popular The of the world are and in the Kremlin by the sure of upon which are sensitive to popular de and incapable of totalitarian political adequate to suppress popular de for an scale of for economic security and social for greater political and for independence in colonial all from to create dignity and in stability within The Kremlin probably that some in the world will be increasingly subjected to unrealistic far beyond the of the to and that the stability of such will be sufficiently disturbed to pro due in the In the Soviet probably believe that present world are not un favorable to Soviet strategic They may expect that the next few will see a deterioration in among the West allies and a gradual isolation of the Up from the rest of the They almost certainly believe that the Up will face increasingly complex in dealing with its allies and with the other that make up the They probe by estimate that which will take place within and among the of the world during the period of this estimate will enhance Soviet opportunity for further and will reduce the likelihood of concerted Western Try in c a F Ta Authority p s F c p F PROBABLE SOVIET Of ACTION Present Soviet We believe that the within the sphere of Soviet power and the Soviet estimate of the world situation which have been in the foregoing have led the Soviet to assess their own sit nation somewhat as the balance of military power in the world and the increase ing destructiveness of nuclear are such that general war would involve very heavy to the Communist ex tending possibly to the destruction of the So system On the other non Communist strength is not so great that with from the present advanced in and seem More the probably seem good that the increase of Bloc military to gather with political defection or dignity on the will gradually shift the balance of power in favor of the Soviet In the the Bloc a full agenda of internal while they do not imply a weakness abandon of expansionism or even the neglect of for expansion under circus of limited do call for attention during the next five at These include the further buildup of comic power in the Bloc as a step toward balancing the vastly greater economic potent till of the and the correction of certain in the Bloc particularly in agricultural We therefore believe that the Soviet will concentrate on the following print final during the period of this To expand Soviet economic To maintain a high level of military read ness and to improve the of the Soviet armed the level comment of greater To increase the political and economic instability of and to render them incapable of decisive action by fostering and within and among To weaken and disrupt the mutual de of and in particular to prevent the armament of West in close association with the Western To isolate the Up from its allies in Eu rope and To expand the area of Communist con tool in southeast External of Action General We believe that ing the period of this estimate the Kremlin will try to avoid of and to deter Communist China from of which in its judgment would clearly involve substantial risk of general the or one of the Soviet Bloc might take action a in which the Up or its rather than yield an important would decide to take contraction substantial risk of general war with the We that the Kremlin would not be de by the risk of general war from taking contraction against a Western action which it considered an imminent threat to Soviet Thus general war might occur The Assistant Chief of and the Director of believe that the following should be substituted for the first sen hence of paragraph the Kremlin will probably try to avoid of action and to deter Communist China from of that entail substantial risk of the in general may be more willing to support of action that would involve risk of a war between the Up and Communist The support given such of action would depend largely on Soviet judgment as to the probable outcome of the If the Soviet that it would result in a severe defeat to or the participation of the general they would probably exert pressure on the to avoid of action which would precipitate On the other if they that the contact could be limited to war in the Far and that it would result greater relative damage to Up than to Communist they probably would support more adventurous of action on the part of the ing the period of this estimate as the climax of a series of and in stated by either which neither side finally intended to lead to general The Soviet almost certainly that as Soviet nuclear in the unwillingness of the and par of its to risk general war will correspondingly and that the lin will therefore have greater freedom of action to promote its without run substantial risk of general As the period of this estimate the will probably be increasingly ready to apply heavy pressure on the world upon any of major dimension or weak ness among the Up and its On the other we believe that the Kremlin will continue to be extremely reluctant to precise tate a contest in which the would ex pet be subjected to nuclear We believe that the extent to which the the freedom of action which its nuclear appear to give and the success which it will de end primarily upon the and cohesiveness of the must Diplomacy and We be live that the during the period of this estimate will almost certainly be unwilling to settle any at the cost of major the will probably seek to continue of major and may make for which will be plausible to some but unacceptable to the The Soviet probably hope that such tactics will carry an implication to the world of Soviet willing ness to negotiate outstanding and stimulate in the world regarding the reasonableness of Up leader apparently intended to ease in international tension probably be alter with political warfare sure calculated to play upon the must fear of We believe that the will place em phases in its diplomacy and ing the period of this upon for the control or abolition of nuclear weak The Soviet will probably try by such to hold out to the must world the prospect release from the threat of nuclear warfare by seeking to place upon the Up the blame for the failure to achieve workable control to stimulate about the reasonableness and moderation of Up in this We believe it highly unlikely that the during the period of this estimate will agree to a system of nuclear control which would involve inspection within the under acceptable to the Western Soviet regarding the control of nuclear will probably be designed primarily to erect political and moral to Up freedom of action in the use of nuclear The will probably seek to support its propaganda and diplomacy with new willingness to ex and its with Soviet trade with the world will probably increase somewhat during the period of this but this trade will con to be small in proportion to New trade will probably be intended not only to obtain desired but also to weaken the economic of non Communist with the and to make strategic trade a subject of very between these and the While the Soviet Union will not be able to bring about a major shift in present trade the probably estimate that po political can be from even small in their current of trade with individual We believe that in the Kremlin will continue to pursue its general objective of weakening Western and impending Western It will con its campaign against the present form of and against bases in Eu The immediate aim to prevent the armament of West and its alliance with the will probably remain the principal target of So policy designed to achieve this So propaganda and diplomacy will be de to strengthen confidence in the peaceful and in the reason ableness of Soviet to stimulate of future German In and to sow resentment of Up as in the a powerful weapon in the large native Communist and will probably continue to be an target in the Soviet campaign to alienate Western from the Up and undermine If the Soviet come to believe that there is little prospect for approval of any formula for the admission of West Ger many to the Western defense they will probably shift their main diplomatic and propaganda effort to West This would in accordance with their present first to deny to the Western defense and ultimately to bring it within the orbit of Soviet A major effort will probably be to develop cultural and economic between East and West at direct political between the two for German Attractive trade are likely to be employed to undermine support in power industrial for present Western If West should be and brought into the Western we believe that Soviet would estimate that this development involved potentially a substantial In threat to the security of the they would probably fear that a West might influence the Western alliance to adopt a more aggressive policy to the Soviet the Soviet would probably estimate that consider able time would lapse before the threat to Bloc security through German armament and that during the interim the German question might create serious dis session within the Western we believe that the Kremlin would react to the beginning of German rear mainly by to divide and destroy the Western These might include a new proposal for Ger man unification which would appear to satisfy the principal which the Western have on this If these should and if the threat to Bloc security to the Kremlin to be markedly increasing by reason of the growth of West German armed the Soviet lead ers would probably increase the scale of their own defense A in the area race might therefore by an increase in international We believe that the the situation in Northeast as for the We believe the Communist will not renew in or agree to a political settlement which would endanger Communist control of North Soviet policy toward Japan is probably based on the assumption that Japan is at present effectively under Up Soviet diplomacy and propaganda will at tempo to disturb and to prevent any substantial contribution by Japan to Up military The Communist whose propaganda impact is disproportionate to its is an important instrument for this In their intent ultimately to death Japan entirely from Up the Soviet probably count on the effect of possible further must gains in on political and on the urgent need for Southeast almost certainly to the Kremlin to be the most profitable field for Communist subversion and armed revolt during the period of this The So will probably continue to give covert support to such if the of local Communist stem late within these or tend to unite these in a program of joint resistance with Western the Kremlin may choose to hold local Communist in The print final concern of Soviet policy in South will be to encourage and exploit the neutral ism already present in the The Soviet probably hope thereby to promote I Flag Auto within the Commonwealth over ways of dealing with Communism in They would expect such to affect and to render difficult the of the West em to enlist the support of plus in effective opposition to further must in We believe the Communist lead ers in general share Soviet about the world situation and about and of advancing Communist in During the period of this Communist China will probably be reluctant to undertake of action which it con sides might involve risk of pro voting unlimited war with a major The major deterrent will Communist China needs time to consolidate the Comma list state as well as to modernize its its strong ground are limited in service and support its expanding air force its navy extremely limited and it will re main militarily dependent upon the for and naval its in industrial will be and the margin of available over mum domestic will be In spite of these and the possibility cannot be that the at some time ing the period of this attempt to carry out recent to and the Communist China will probably counter with military to the full extent of its any action which it to be a military threat to its or to constitute an eminent threat to its vital the of war inherent in such Communist probably share the Soviet view that Southeast the most favorable for Communist not only because of the vulnerability of the in the but because of the possibility of dis between the Up and its The will almost certainly at tempo to extend their gains in and will probably expand their to subvert neighboring by political infiltration and covert support of local we do not believe that the will at tempo to secure their in southeast by the commitment of identifiable bat of Communist armed at during the early period of this we find the situation in this area so fluid the we are unable to estimate beyond this early Middle Since its withdrawal from in the apparently not given high priority to Communist active in the Middle This may have been due to such as Soviet preoccupation with more important the weakness of local Communist in the and the fact that even without Soviet initiative the in the area were already unfavorable to the In recent there have been of Communist activity in the To the ex tent that the Western succeed in reversing the unfavorable to them and in building toward a situation of strength in this we believe that the will in for progress crease its is made in the development of the plan for Middle East

THE Up THROUGH THE PROBLEM To estimate the degree of advance warning that could be provided by intelligence hi the event of Soviet on and overseas through INTRODUCTORY THE NATURE Of WARNING When the advance warning of Soviet attack which intelligence may be able to it is necessary to define various possible of Warning of the likelihood of probably resulting either from So or Soviet to Western but not any direct of increasing Soviet military readiness to but without define time evidence of intent to attack or of the time of Warning of clear intent to Warning of clear intent to attack at or about a particular It now improbable that stage or possibly even stage would be con exclusively except in the event of high level penetration of the Soviet which today or in case of some exceptional intelligence bonus or break While intelligence might be able to say that the would be fully to attack say it would find it very difficult to say whether such connected a firm intent to were primarily in anticipation of an Up were a deception or were to prepare against any con When we speak of degree of it is important to bear in mind that both time and specificity are and that the the warning the less specific it is likely to This inverse relation between time and specificity is an inherent limitation of the warning the Soviet attack on the Up would be tantamount to general this estimate also with the warning which the Up would be likely to receive of Soviet Initiation of general It does not consider the warning likely to be given by Up or Allied c The fact that warning is likely to be in some degree imprecise or contingent also importance to other affecting the warning The degree of warning which can be will always be dependent on many some of them unique to any given set of Warning will depend first of all on maximum alertness and a maximum scale of continuous effort by These would probably be only in a period of rising ten son and might be even if the tension to if there were intermittent of or if intelligence had obviously given false The effectiveness of warning also on the con tinged credibility of to responsible for warning pro less is complete only when it is The warning process is thus affected by the whole context of in which it psychological and even pure It cannot be as a mechanical process which it is possible for intelligence to set up once and for all and which thereafter We believe that a Soviet initiation of general war by on the its or key overseas would almost certainly be by height end While such son in itself constitute warning that war more the of Soviet which would probably be could be in as evidence of for defense or as part of a war of Soviet behavior in a period of poll tension would not necessarily give specific warning of a So intention to intelligence could probably give warning of the increasing war readiness and could probably chart the trend to ward a period of maximum If the chose to initiate war with and air after a period of there would be numerous of as well as of economic and political necessary to prepare such We believe that Up intelligence might be able to give a generalized of warning as long as four or possibly even six prior to and that the minimum period would not be less than After the number of would probably be reduced due to Soviet although the latter would themselves provide From and especially there would probably be of last minute although these on a timely basis would probably be As the time of attack drew of its approach would become increasingly Based on Soviet military warn ing could probably be given from a few to a few days in advance of the dual of the In order to gain some degree of sur the might choose to initiate general war by of less than full for by an attack on West with the currently toned in East while simulate only the Up and key overseas Even the minimum which the would have r I by a major be to a to take to assemble its in East many in forward to put them point where only in a state of readiness to and to would be in advance of a provide support after the attack mum attack of aircraft In this the period of warning might be re would probably require about used to the time for the staging We believe that warning of the probability operation at the of attack could be about one week and Kola Intelligence might be in but the period might vary from a few to as much as able to discover the movement of aircraft to the staging and if this move depending on the seasonal pattern of was in fact we believe military that warning could be given at least If the chose to undertake a the aircraft before air attack on the ing the aircraft which we the early warning radar in could be if this movement was not warning of attack could be given for such an attack in only if continuous reconnaissance of the tensile prior would be staging was being carried We believe that the In such a the period of warning might would probably assume a meaningful be reduced to a few or even virtue pattern in time for intelligence to give warning days prior to ally to because of probable have in and in and the Of the that the bases in the and have capacity aircraft in we do not believe that they are entry capable of doing so at short we believe it virtually possible that an attack of this scale against the Up in could achieve a high degree of A used scale of attack to achieve a high free of surprise even in By the and of the Soviet Air Force There are two possible ways which the might by possibly somewhat before that launch attack on the Up in such a way that no specific warning would be likely before the actual of the Assuming that the ahead with development of its advance bases in the and Kola and with the general prep ration of its Air a pattern of activity these bases would tend to be Under these a able number of aircraft would almost mainly be able to take off from these bases from for a surprise at tack upon the Up without any such un usual prior or assembly as Assistant Chief of and the Direct tor of Naval Intelligence from this judgment in on the ground that intelligence is Insufficient to warrant a finite estimate of the number of aircraft could be for the full text of the dissent see paragraph would particularly attract the attention of Allied Assuming that the an flight refueling capability it can do although there is no evidence at that the Soviet Air Force is this and it to the essay Soviet could be from home bases without staging at advanced refer from tanker aircraft in order to attain the necessary range for upon the We have in IE that the have about tanker aircraft in even assume ing that some mission aircraft from the home bases such as re no the scale of such an attack would probably be substantially less than the If the concurrently with any of the scales of un undertook offensive submarine against the Up and key overseas install necessary for the sub marine fleet to proceed to wartime patrol shortly before the tenement of The passage of these if would sup port up to two warning of Soviet preparation for attack against the Up and key overseas Soviet to receive a retail story blow from Allied air power would probably provide some of Soviet Minimum would probably include the of air defense and the civil defense of military and for of to locate Up carrier the evacuation of key per sonnet or even considerable of population from potential target and some to increase Soviet ability to recuperate from nuclear If these were they would probably provide a warning period of as much a week to taken in conjunction with other would greatly increase the definiteness of any warning us might be able to DISCUSSION WARNING SOVIET BEHAVIOR In VARIOUS The various possible in which the might decide to attack the Up and enter upon general war would have a considerable bearing on the degree of warn ing which might be There are three in which the might decide to attack the Up and key overseas thus general These would arise if the So came to that the had acquired such military that it could be certain of success in a general that an attack by the Up and its allies on the was

between certain defeat in war and sacrifice of its vital We believe that the Soviet are unlikely to come to any of these during the period of this b There remains a possibility that general war might occur after a series of and some local crisis which neither nor the Western Allies finally intended to lead to general If the that the at stake were vital to its security or that the loss of prestige involved in backing down would be equally dangerous to Soviet and if it that the Up would not then the might decide that general war was the un available consequence of the crisis and that it should seize the We believe that if the to launch general war in the period through the decision is most likely to come as the consequence of such a Likelihood of a Period of In the situation under a Soviet decision to attack the Up by a period of even if the Soviet any one of the three in they would probably do so because of an important shift in international or because of some equally open and marked or impending of the relative weight of military Such would themselves be likely to produce political There are how which a Soviet decision for wat be taken the absence of political For a Soviet decision as under above might be the result of some technical advance in Soviet military capable unknown to the Western or a So decision as under above might be the result of some secret technical advance in Western military of which Soviet intelligence We be live that such are unlikely to since an attack on the if it is most likely to be the result of the situation in paragraph and would in that case inevitably be by a period of we conclude that a Soviet attack on the Up and key over would almost certainly be by a period of Reliability of Political in a Period of While the existence of a prior period of tension would in itself tube warning that war was becoming more it would also greatly increase the cult of from Soviet political savior a specific warning of Most of the political

while they might provide warning of the in likelihood of they would not provide specific warning of attack Reliability of Military in a Period of Tale existence of a period political tension would also make more difficult the determination from Soviet military of a specific in tent to If in such a period the undertook various military it would probably be as difficult to distinguish offensive from defensive intent as in the case of from Soviet political In a protracted situation of this sort genre probably could only give warning of the increasing war readiness and chart the trend toward the period of maximum dan but not warn of a Soviet intention to The might carry through these not in order to initiate war but in readiness for instant retaliation to a Up attack which it feared was Possibility of Soviet It would also be possible for the Soviet after a period of tension in which they had brought both their political and military prep to an advanced to bring about an amelioration of the crisis atmosphere as a f deception They could offer as a basis for new and simulate reduction of some of their military prepare or even actually reduce If they considered surprise essential to their strategic and that they still could achieve some degree of surprise in their initial this would be a likely course for the Soviet to such a course would involve sacrifice of some important ad An initial surprise assault at Western retaliatory power would probably have to include air on the of some which the might other wise have had some hope of being able to It would also involve the clear assumption of responsibility for in war by aggressive and thus might garden the will to resist in Western the Soviet would probably accept these and at tempo deceptive political if they considered that the maximum degree of sur rise obtainable was essential to their stra topic large degree of deception Although a into Soviet would be might still be able detect continuation of military Such could be as due to Soviet caution and but they would also point to the possibility of a deep maneuver and they would be particularly significant as evidence of a Soviet intention to achieve surprise in general that We Soviet behavior in a period of political tension would not necessarily give warning of It would establish the the likelihood of general war was increasing and probably that Soviet readiness for gen real war was also It would also lead to activity and sensitivity on the part of Allied neither a belligerent and yielding attitude nor a defensive and conciliatory one would be a sure guide to Soviet Of SOVIET ATTACK One course open to the would be a attack on the Up and only on allied with the after a period of Such a plan of attack would sacrifice strategic surprise in favor of maximum military al though the might still hope to achieve some degree of tactical The range of necessary for such full mobilization of war potential in a highly state like the is so ex tensile and so many affect ing broad of the population that even a totalitarian government would find it possible to conceal all of In the comic a complex redirection and intent unification of productive effort would have to take were transferred from consumption and investment goods to armament in These would probably be impossible without the use of public informal Manipulation of domestic open ion is so persistent a preoccupation of the Soviet Government and its concern over pop lar morale under of crisis is so intense that its vast propaganda apparatus would certainly be openly to parking the Soviet to the military field of general the induction of additional military formation of new and fishing out of to full find and more realistic deployment of combat to forward in the Sat and a variety of logistic would hardly escape entirely the observation of Western In it would be difficult to avoid detection of large scale troop in East Specific which if would give warning of attack on the Up would arise from the of the Soviet Air These are in We believe that we would be most likely to receive numerous of Soviet mobilization in the period from about six to about one month before largely because the likely to be up to this time would be those From least roughly to around susceptible of that Western we would be likely to get much less in the way of because the in this period would be those which Soviet security is best to More by about one month before the progressive of Soviet security would probably have a high There would almost certainly be a re auction in information from within the at the same the dry ing up of internal Bloc because of in security itself pro video an indication of Soviet in the period from and especially we could expect of last minute At this there would be a serious problem of such on a sufficiently timely intelligence We believe would probably be able to sort the variety of into a meaningful pattern at a real timely early stage of Soviet mobilization for a Up intelligence might be come aware of this mobilization as long as four or possibly even six prior to The minimum would not be less than Even though in intelligence was able to give only a generalized degree of showing the progressive increase of Soviet war it would probably still be able to chart the trend of to anticipate their probable course to and thus to designate the beginning of a period of mum It might even be able to idea tiny of Soviet mobilization which because of their uniqueness or extreme costliness could be specifically as evidence of an intention to As the time of attack drew of its approach would become increase singly Based on Soviet mile try warning could probably be given from a few to a few days in ad dance of the actual of the This would be very if Soviet when their for attack were known to be near undertook and ground or major These might provide evidence of Soviet mention to but would the difficulty of the time of such It must also be in theory at the could always re train from or delay even after were Hence the in of military taken by would not necessarily provide concur evidence that attack was PROBABLE Of WARNING In THE Of HAN ATTACK Even if the to achieve the utmost surprise in general war and accepted all on its prior it would still probably consider a minimum number prior a matter of necessity and elementary presence in order to be in a position to wage general At least some of the general prepare in Section In above would almost certainly have to be even if a high degree of prior mobilization was Some of these would be by Allied but it might be very difficult to ascertain any such clear pattern of as would be discernible in for full believe it though that these prepare would not lead to a warning of especially if they were carried out over a long period of time and with careful If the the Up and key overseas without full prior mo utilization for general and hence without in other two general would be The could combine its attack against the Up and key overseas with a ground campaign chiefly in Western without prior reinforcement of its in East The could undertake initially and possibly other of against The could of course strengthen this ground attack by degree of prior For the purpose of this however we take the above case as the limiting any prior reinforcement would tend to provide add and hence additional warning the Up and key overseas but delay its ground and discernible for other military until after these initial Soviet Campaign in and Simultaneous on the Up and Key Overseas If the chose to initiate general war by an attack on Western with the currently in East and the together with on the Up and key overseas the degree of its war before such would vary greatly depending on the intensity and duration of which the as we think there had been a long period of the might have already a considerable degree of military and comic mobilization for and its foreign and domestic political preparation might be well as we have the derived from this range of warning of the likelihood of be of significance for warning of this type of Even the local which the would still have to take at a minimum for an attack with in East would provide some degree of warn Some time would be to asset major in forward although this would vary period would be between May and August when are split between home and field training a ser period would be between Novel ber and March when are consolidated at home the minimum period re would be in when are ing to training and in ber when are either engaged in large scale or are being back to home Other minimum prepare would include the release from stocks of and in quant in excess of those used even on well In some two before the attack it would probably be necessary to begin the movement of large of and rolling stock from East to the Soviet border in order to prepare for resupply and reinforcement to support and expand the often the would probably be engaged in these over a period of about days and Up intelligence would probably begin to acquire some at an early although with the season of the We believe that warning of the probability of attack could be given about one week in in the absence of other and with Soviet to be part of a normal pat tern the warning could vary as from a few to a few days in and in from two to five days in the period from five to days in the period If the undertook concurrent often submarine against Up and key overseas it would be say for the submarine fleet to proceed to wartime patrol shortly the of The passage of these if would support up to two warning of Soviet preparation for attack against the Up and key overseas The extent to which the go ing on simultaneously for air attack on the Up and key overseas would tend to confirm advance the warning would depend somewhat upon the scale of these as Initial on the Up and Key Overseas For the of this estimate it necessary to consider two of air on the Up and key overseas install a maximum effort as many aircraft as an attack designed to achieve a high degree of The could undertake these air on the Up and key overseas simultaneously with a attack or with the ground campaign and submarine in the could initiate general war with such air at while delaying discernible prepare fat other military in order to increase the likelihood of surprise against the In this the very disparity between for air and those for other general war would be a highly significant indicator of the probable nature of the initial Soviet Maximum Scale We have in that by its maximum capability the could now aircraft against the Up in an initial attack and that by this number could be to Extent prior would be particularly in the early part of the period covered by this These would in improving maintenance and fuel storage in the and Kola personnel equipment to full strength in air training of air frequency of training and of At present such would require at least several and would probably be come known to Up especially forward with great if carried Throughout the period of this estimate the critical would be those to of activity at staging bases in the and Kola We believe that the would probably assume a meaningful pattern in time for in intelligence to give a generalized degree of warn ing days prior to On the other such could be gradually over the next few By the and equipment of the Soviet Air Force could be ad to a point where only minimum prep would be in advance of an For it might not then be The warning problem would probably not be sig different if some portion of these air craft were necessary to undertake such final prepare as the movement of personnel and equip or these might be on such a reduced scale that they might not be dis Under these of the taking place in the Soviet Air Force might be and warning of air attack would depend al most entirely on received during the staging of aircraft through advanced In the course of the staging process Allied intelligence might be able to discover the movement of aircraft to the staging If this movement was in fact we be live that in warning could be given at before aircraft the early warning radar handling capability at staging bases and reduction of flight time by of jet aircraft might decrease the warn ing derived from discovery of movement of air craft to staging bases to a minimum of about before aircraft the early warning radar if this movement was not warning of at tack could be given only if continuous the staging was being carried In such the of warning might be reduced to a few or even virtually to because of probable and in and in the of the If Up overseas were to be the additional prep which would be necessary would not add significantly to the of The air arm would already be in a maximum condition of readiness and the reading of the light bomber which would be used for on Up in in Western the and some of the Middle East could be accomplished without serious additional risk of If were employed in such no warning of their use would be apart from the generalized warn ing which might have been derived from prior Surprise We have in that if the a SECRET surprise attack against the Up in air craft would probably be from stag ing bases in the and Kola The capacity of these bases was to be We do not be that these bases are currently ready to launch this scale of attack on short would be which would probably be by Allied genre and would permit a generalized degree of warning of about to Accord we believe it virtually impossible that an attack of this scale against the Up during could achieve a high degree of A reduced scale of attack to air a high degree of surprise even in In as is evident from and the provided base and equipment of the Soviet Air Force were sufficiently launch its maximum air attack of aircraft against the Up under such con that the period of warning would able be of the order of but might be considerably less if the movement of to staging bases was not The maximum Soviet air attack could achieve a high degree of Even if the chose to substantially the total ber of in the it would still probably use the and Kola bases to full and therefore not greatly reduce the likelihood of discovery of aircraft moving to staging There are two possible ways which the might by possibly some what before that launch an attack on the Up in such a way that no specific warning would be likely before the actual of the Assuming that the ahead with development of its advance bases in the The Assistant Chief of and the Direct tor of Naval Intelligence from this judgment in on the ground that intelligence is insufficient to warrant a finite estimate of the number of aircraft which could be

the bases A pattern of activity would tend to be Under these a considerable number of aircraft would almost certainly be able to take off from these bases from for a surprise attack upon the Up with out any such unusual prior or assembly as would particularly attract the attention of Allied We are un able to estimate the number of aircraft which might be in a position to participate in such an

as no the scale of such an attack would be substantially less than the WARNING SOVIET To RECEIVE LA OR A To An important element not included in the foregoing examination is that of Soviet de offensive to receive a retaliatory blow from Allied air Minimum prep would probably include the of air defense and the civil defense of military and for air the dispatch ing of to locate Up carrier

warning Up genre might be able to The risk which the would be willing to accept as a result of some or all of this type of defensive preparation would depend in part on the degree of success which the Soviet their own initial attack to We believe that in elementary dance they would be unwilling to forgo all preparation to receive a retaliatory and some important of this type would probably be THE PROBABLE SOVIET CHOICE BETWEEN A AND A SURPRISE ATTACK The Soviet choice between a at tack or some one of the alternative scales of surprise attack would probably depend in part on the intensity and duration of the crisis which the Soviet decision to The shown in try doctrine for offensive action after maximum preparation and a high degree of superiority to the enemy been might argue for the postponement of decision to the last possible A crisis might thus result during which Soviet general mobilization would be brought near to This might make at tack feasible and would also facilitate deep On the other the might estimate that the process of mobilization especially if it included forward move of large of into the lite would cause a Western and result in the initial attack being made on rather than by the Probably the argument tor a So surprise would be overwhelming importance to the of effectively bunting Up retaliatory power and Up We believe that in the period through the

the in size of the Soviet nuclear stock pile and the to be available from nuclear will make an increasingly practicable of nuclear despite their in reliability and because of these we believe that the will place mary reliance on aircraft delivery of nu clear so long as the Soviet stock pile remains limited and Allied air de can be without capable We that these would not employment of nuclear when the of surprise or other so Although we have no evidence to con firm current Soviet missile pro we believe that the Allies face a growing Soviet missile threat within the next several threat will probably appear first in See Rest u or Soviet air defense together with or by Soviet against Up and Allied coastal and sea of community and in tactical Later the threat will probably extend to all

without consideration of or pro auction We the rate at which these could be turned out at capacity the labor and Input and the are gate cost or such a program Annex The of this illustrative while net

capacity for an extensive missile except possibly m the of precision and electronic Indeed our analysis up the absolute of missile ma except possibly for liquid a decided quality pro would also In aggregate as a sizeable missile program would be well within Soviet For in the three year period our illustrate time missile program would represent about percent of Soviet defense The chief bottleneck in any extensive Soviet production program would almost mainly lie in the precision and electronics Although our estimate does not permit a precise it that if our illustrative program were as rapidly as it might re quite a large share of Bloc electronics output over an extended This share could be reduced somewhat by greater capital invest The problem would be most difficult in the early when an of the Soviet electronics Authority Q p c F T put might be for the illustrative pro the air defense require Although of the were not specifically considered m our hypothetical air

importance of many of the de for Soviet electronic output try early warning fire and intercept it unlikely that the would allocate such a high proportion to actual missile A more serious limitation to satisfying the missile may well exist in the precision mechanism sector in view of the involved and the skilled labor re For the average annual missile requirement for in the early of our illustrative program may be approximately of the by the to new military equip during have no estimate of total Soviet production of Effect of Soviet Nuclear on Missile Use We have of a possible associate between the Soviet missile program and the Soviet nuclear Almost all the which we estimate the is of could be fitted with nuclear our of the So nuclear stockpile indicate that for the See Annex for of Soviet stockpile and next several it will be to meet probable military and that reliability and accuracy of delivery will be primary in the Soviet choice of The yield the nuclear war which we estimate would be available at present for Soviet would not be sufficient to compensate for the lack of race which we estimate these would The available from such war will progressively but the real between yield and missile accuracy is such that the effectiveness of nuclear delivery by in of of target will not approach that obtainable by aircraft delivery tor the next several This factor obviously does not preclude employment of nuclear where other so but it does suggest primary Soviet reliance on aircraft delivery of nuclear so long as the Soviet stockpile remains limited and Allied air de can be without Probable Missile Another major factor affecting the Soviet choice between and other particularly nuclear de will be masse the de free of likelihood that a missile fired will actually reach the target We do not believe that missile reliability for unopposed delivery will for the foreseeable future preach that of Up experience sup that the of the of missile development is such that a system reliability factor of the order of percent might presently be Soviet in and Cartography The bas in a geodesic organization whose scientific and technical personnel are capable of dependable and adequate support in all of geodesic and cartography Authority by a missile The high level or Soviet geodesic bas from early recognition of the basic importance of geodesic and cartography to Soviet economic development and military which led to a geodesic and cartography program on an unprecedented We estimate that the can now achieve relative geodesic of fixed In the with a circular probable

during the period through extensive and with the geodesic adjoining By lunar and electronic or the con will reduce the geodesic of winning at to not more than This improvement in geo accuracy may result either from Soviet or gravimetric or more likely from Western it re of these continue to be made available to the through open and Training Logistic We estimate that for each missile in the basic allowance of a field an additional two to three would have to be produced for train replacement of defective in the and pipeline In Up experience any Soviet vehicular for the support of missile will also be For a Corporal battalion an impressive number of very heavy and other in excess of gross weight would create major port Such as the ID probably would have no mobility but would have to be at or the as simply in general we believe that transport would not be a serious limiting factor on any Soviet missile al though this program would naturally compete with other Soviet transport The complexity of and related test and guidance equipment a high premium on technically trained personnel in operational The illustrate time program in Annex tor ex might require in the early a strength of as many as and ultimately relatively highly trained to and operate the various size We that as with other complex the could train personnel of the care to support a although meet ing such personnel needs would involve a major effort and would naturally compete with other personnel On the basis of Up we estimate that roughly one year would be for the individual training of certain key missile Subsequent unit act nation and training would require from to a In some the might find It difficult to train and activate such as rapidly as could produce the in which case training would become a limiting factor on Soviet missile On the other once missile personnel were the transition from early to later masse would be by the basic similarity of missile PROBABLE SOVIET In THE GUIDE MISSILE

Soviet strategic objective in event of general war will be the defense of the against strategic The al ready given a very high postwar priority to all given for missile villa ability are the probable during which small of could have been produced and the of personnel of one operational thus a limited capability for operational These are on the assumption that a concerted and continuous by If no

around which the could have been tested and be ready tor series an additional period would vary according to missile would be before could be produced quantity and the necessary trained and We mate that at least six would normally be or conversion from pilot plant to and an additional period to reach the production Some to two would probably be for individual and unit training of each

weapon which will provide an effective defense against high performance bomber under of poor We have that the is of ready for series in an de sign with an effective slant range of and in an version with and effective slant We believe that the will make every effort to develop such because of their early availability and the fact that even the employed in would radically improve Soviet air its short range would limit its use to a point and numerous peripheral would be for effectively major target This weapon would pro able also have sharply limited against multiple or low altitude The version would be less limited in range and its head would be more against multiple In the should be capable of a new missile with final a and still greater Its range would per the use or a smaller

Soviet inter center against jet There fore we believe that the would assign high priority to its production as a valuable interim new with radar which we estimate the could develop by would have an er

be the primary So interceptor Potential Military U beginning around the solid propellant rocket coming general use in Soviet their kill probability against jet un fair weather would probably be substantially The which most Soviet interceptor could probably be after would greatly enhance Soviet The formidable and growing Soviet sub marine fleet and surface navy indicate Soviet strategic emphasis on the sea of communication on which the Allies As Allied for defense of and the will require for this Progress in the air of naval task will probably make aircraft tor peso and Soviet conventional bomb delivery lack the accuracy necessary for use against we believe that the would almost certainly produce in quantity any precision weapon available for effectively with high explosive We estimate that the could now have available an pound glide bomb with nautical mile range and a pound He or nuclear An new Restricted Since weapon would afford a of accurate He against point such as it would probably be even though its To would limit it to good since the range or this missile would still be so short as to afford only limited security to the parent the So probably would continue te consider that nuclear might be more effectively de lived directly by and would not equip this missile with a nuclear The probable availability In of a suitable acoustic torpedo could fur increase the effectiveness of this We also believe that for the next several the will rely primarily on Its growing high performance bomber capable tor on key Allied bases and install at some time in the future the growing effectiveness of Allied air create a growing Soviet requirement Cor an weapon to penetrate these de without excessive bomber At this time the will probably seek to pro due an missile with a nuclear Allied nuclear bases and and other heavily m Authority In the probably could have ready for series production an pound aircraft with nautical mile range and a nuclear except In case of clandestine place of a beacon In the target it would be United to use fair weather or against ship While its range might enable parent aircraft to stay beyond the range of Allied defensive the pilot less aircraft itself would be vulnerable to in Its size and weight would also restrict the performance of the parent air and it could be carried only by heavy and medium bomber For these rea and because direct bomber delivery will probably still be we do not believe that the would produce this weapon in if at in when we estimate that a supersonic with mile range and a nuclear could be the would probably expect Allied around key to be such as gravely to limit effective direct bomber delivery of nuclear Any limitation on the reliability of this would pro able be more than offset by the likelihood of penetrating target After the size of the Soviet nuclear stockpile likely to be such as to justify allocation of nuclear material for this weapon despite the reliability By this progress in Soviet nuclear technology could also be such as to permit a high yield in which case the weight of the missile and the on its accuracy would be of less Annex Re we believe that the would undertake quantity production such a if for use by heavy and medium against well target Potential Military Should the put into use an weapon like the glide it would sig strengthen the Soviet challenge to Allied empower in If an supersonic coming Into use around it would greatly increase the Allied air and probably dictate primary reliance upon long range interception or the parent The with its growing submarine will almost certainly belly for to attack Allied and bases in coastal those in the The might consider such to have lar value against key industrial and military bases along the Up We have that in the could have had available an type with a high explosive and in a twin By both could have a nuclear head Annex Restricted These would provide a capability for sub on Up coastal tar to

on antisubmarine i Authority In the light of probable Soviet strategic the probably a series of for neutralize Allied nuclear delivery at their missile provide an tactical nuclear capability in battle

of and which might lead the to consider aircraft a better of its limited nuclear stock The could use from ground with somewhat the three pilotless aircraft whose use was in and Since they would be of lim item accuracy and their vulnerability would approach that of we believe it that the would choose to develop any significant operational this We believe that the So would favor ballistic because of their relative immunity to presently known We have also that the could have ready for series production the losing basic in an elongated type with a pound He and nautical mile in an na time design with much less range but a pound and greater in an elongated type with a pound and nautical mile in at the possible date in a thrust with mile range and a nuclear and in at the possible date m an with

combat radius of Soviet jet light as well as medium The last two would be markedly inferior in range in the new jet medium The chief which these ballistic appear to offer is their input notability to interception and their capable for surprise To counter growing nuclear in the will probably give high priority to a missile for support of its field The proved or native design to be now available would satisfy this if considerably accuracy could be In this considerable effort might be devoted to its aside from this we be live that the would seek to produce ballistic in quantity only it they ex

assured of for the next several the Soviet missile effort will probably be concentrated more upon development of ballistic than upon quantity production of in term When the that Allied air will soon pose a major threat to successful aircraft it will probably undertake a heavy investment in By the growth of the Soviet nuclear stockpile and the probably available would have reduced the significance

Soviet missile program we have set up an illustrative Soviet pro gram and Soviet to carry it Our illustrative program who it Is based upon a set of retinal Soviet military which are not necessarily indicative of an actual Soviet although we have to make them Our analyses of Soviet production capable are admittedly They are based on of production table Up ruble conversion and other which are subject to a considerable margin of even though our do not permit else they do permit some broad as to what the could do it HYPOTHETICAL S IT MISSILE Our first step was to construct a set of hypothetical Soviet missile For each missile type which we the would desire to we have the number which it would need to meet initial wartime stockpile Although the program took into account the state of the it was based only on military require without consideration of de or production The program is a generous designed to meet the offensive and defensive missile require of the Soviet but it does not specifically provide for the air defense the or the of Satellite We believe that these illustrative require serve as a reasonable basis for ana lying what sort of production program the could For costing since we have no Soviet missile we have into the of roughly counterpart Up we have taken the probable date at which it been that each missile of the above type could be tested and ready for series In line with Up experience we believe that it would take on the an additional six between this time and the time at which tooling up for series production would be and production would begin coming oft the we selected the cal end year as the one in which the could begin series The reference to discussion of the classification of these in Section In or this was as in Table ABLE I us

these plant and the would em ploy capacity multiple U one shift operation were used the time pattern would naturally be substantially and No attempt was made to adjust the Up data tor in Up and Soviet production because the size of such are unknown and because most of the Up data are not on actual production but on production SOVIET To SPORT THE A PRODUCTION PROGRAM Available Industrial A survey of available intelligence of Soviet industrial available to fulfill missile require revealed no likely on the assumed except in precision and electronics Some capacity in the airframe industry devoted to consumer goods and other could be used in the missile since missile frame production is not restricted to airframe the un of the of Defense Industry or and true Machine Building probably could really be particularly for the smaller it that during Soviet jet engine at only about percent capacity over type No in formation is available on the production of liquid rocket but liquid rocket family are not peculiar to any one type of in and handling equipment and are not and would represent no foreseeable production problem to the Labor and Material Input The input necessary to meet the assumed production were deter where on the basis of input data for the counterpart Up Where such data was not as for certain assumed Soviet in were determined by scaling the Cor portal by the ratio of the weight of the Soviet missile component to that of the respective Corporal was scaled by for the Soviet If the the assumed product the program at capacity scale of effort would require some people by the third The peak requirement of would be in about This peak labor requirement would include technical and managerial In the light of the growth of pop skilled and engineering and technical in the Soviet Union be teen and seem unlikely to place any general construct on the assumed Some quality time might A similar determination of basic up their ex kept possibly for liquid as a bulk problem clearly would not be a matter of major Our examination of the qualitative of the problem that for the most part satisfactory for are available to the ECONOMIC MET AND Up to this point our have been based on assumed Soviet for the aged system must be added to the missile needs or Soviet would be seriously In view of the complexity of an missile system and the great variety of individual in the this problem was in aggregate money recognize that money are an imprecise Authority method of Soviet production and but does permit a general order of Our calculation of system is since It such as special and plat form the initial wartime stockpile and training missile and special equipment and drone aircraft We have con ordered that certain other are not properly charitable to the missile pro more are part of other and can therefore be from our These include the in and handling for the organizational and such as and opera support and drone Nor have we included such as the early warning network and The in intermediate and superior command and the cost of providing and troop are also ex The entire program through under our would require cumulative of about billion or somewhat under billion the absence of we have been to calculate Soviet missile of the dollar of Up with appropriate which were then con vertex to by a We recognize that the Up dollar used themselves based on Up of production which might themselves be sub jet to a substantial margin of The bal of system were similarly derived on the assumption that the could not cut any considerable without per An examination of the economic sector origin of the bulk of the revealed the sec ton concerned are those In which the ruble dollar approximate which the relationship between Soviet and Up and the pattern of the nation

all phases of the gram the from these were and they for about percent of the total cost of the a procedure parallel to that used for total we have the value of electronic equipment and precision involved in our illustrative missile program Table The re against these two interrelated sec of the program could not readily be and we have no estimate of Soviet production in the precision much some notion of the magnitude of such on the Soviet electronics industry can be by assume as a first that the entire requirement is for electronic On this the requirement would amount to about percent of electronics output for the entire period of the program or percent of the combined and Satellite production for the same During the about of total production would be or about hall the combined production of the and the count for of the total program in these To arrive at an approximation of the equipment requirement we mate very roughly that it between and of the lined electronics and precision On this basis the illustrative Soviet missile program would consume about of the electronics output of the and during Such heavy on the available electronic supply in to would have to compete with other military and try One possible allocation of available electronics might involve cutting back military other than for to the average and leaving the nonmilitary at and Under an alternative allocation of available electronics the military other might be cut back to a leaving the nonmilitary at and In either it is clear that the missile electronics and vision mechanism as an electronics requirement could be but consumption for other would have to be sharply A more serious limitation to satisfying the missile may well exist in the precision mechanism sector in view of the tolerance involved and the skilled labor re For example the number of for new equipment in was between and which approximately percent were for aircraft few of these are of the degree of precision and

concerned over the posse ability of Up military and they would probably fear that invasion would induce the neutral in to move toward open with the The Min is a conciliatory line toward thus seeking

would be greater than by the simple addition of a particular number of West German On the other the Soviet probably mate that it would require about three to complete the rear program in West They would probably that the potential threat involved in West Ger man armament would not emerge at an early date and that there would re main time for possible We believe it that the initial Soviet response to ratification of the would be based on the assumption that the security of the was immediately We believe that the would take to improve its military the strengthening of East Ger man and Satellite in connection with the formal establishment of an East em security It would employ all political and subversive prevent or impede armament in West and to obstruct its operation with its Western It would attempt to make gains under of limited in order partially to offset the accretion to West em strength resulting from German re this In conjunction with general line of we believe that the might for a a more menacing harassment of the Western allies in Berlin and We that the So would be concerned not to allow any increase of international ten from such to get out of We believe that the would be after an to negotiate further on but Authority would be highly unlikely to agree to Ger man unification on acceptable to the If at any stage in the process of the the of action above did in the Soviet sufficiently offset the threat of German rear we believe the Soviet would almost certainly take further in the attempt to counter this accretion to the strength of the These would include primarily a sharp of Soviet and Satellite military They might also include more threatening of action against or in the Far or else with the purpose of rousing fear of nuclear war in the West and causing Western to demand that their follow a cautious We believe at this the would adopt of action than it had but would avoid those which in its judgment clearly the probability of general It is possible that the Soviet may at any time decide that they cannot adequately offset the threat of German In they would with two broad to undertake an early showdown with the Western on this possibly use of force grave of general to attempt to negotiate a settle in which both Western and Soviet would be withdrawn and a run find would be with We believe the would reject the first alternative as too hazardous a gamble under currently In view of the grave we believe the second alternative is only a possible but it might be adopted if the Soviet it the only short of general to prevent the de development of a critical threat to the se purity of the We that the Kremlin would be more likely to adopt paragraph DISCUSSION Of In POSTWAR SOVIET POLICY The role that a would eventually come to play in been a key issue in the postwar power struggle between the and the western Despite the tremendous postwar growth of with that of Soviet of sustained by the a powerful Soviet policy in since designed to prevent any man settlement which would permit the a on the side of the This policy patently been based on a belief that the add of German power to the Western alliance would constitute a serious blow to Soviet would seriously hamper further Comma list expansion in threaten Soviet con tool over the and perhaps even jeopardize the security of the The armament of even West and its inclusion in the alliance is almost mainly by the Soviet in a per respective of such and PROBABLE SOVIET ESTIMATE Of THE SIGNIFICANCE Of RATIFICATION We believe that the Soviet would regard armament of West and t Authority I i I its inclusion in as a serious potential threat to their own They would not take this view because of the importance they attach to the German plus appropriate air and naval but rather because they regard it as probable that German armed power would not be to these They almost certainly believe that establishment of West German would be by a reserve training system which would enable the even tally to place a much force on footing at short They probably also believe that the inclusion of German would improve the of the whole body of in When they take account further of the addition of West industrial and scientific to those of they probably recognize that the net increase in the strength of the military combination which the in would be greater than by the simple add of a particular of West German The may estimate that considerable could arise from West German rear quite apart from the strength which to The Soviet may fear that a and relatively independent would eventually embark on an aggressive policy to recover East and through inadvertent or and without the approval of its part provoke a clash which could lead to general They probably have little faith in the ability of the other Western to curb an independent and if aggressive should come to Over and above the specific increase of Western military strength resulting from West German the Soviet may feel that this development could lately have unfavorable strategic A West would sent a serious additional obstacle to any Soviet attempt to overrun Western More while the strategic flexibility of the would be curtailed as the result of the appearance of a local threat in a vital sector of the the once West German armed power acquired signify cant would acquire strategic flexibility in the disposition of their own The Soviet might also estimate that the Up would local aggression in Eastern by German without involvement of the Up By thus the own technique of aggression by proxy the Up could pole a fateful choice for the whether to risk loss of important piecemeal or to intervene with Soviet with the risk that general war would The Soviet probably also estimate that the armament of West would constitute a serious political which at least for some time would considerably diminish their for political in They pro able fear that the existence of a sovereign West growing in power and would increase the difficulty of main training internal security in East In West would exercise a magnetic attraction on East which might create a serious resistance problem for the East German They may also fear that the achievement of such a success in would lead the perhaps to action by the German once in Western to adopt further which would threaten Soviet con tool over its or at least prove costly to Soviet they may mate that Soviet ability to influence the of neutral and neutrality in and would be reduced by the general gain in Western strength the must On the other the Soviet probably estimate that it would require about three to complete the rear program in West They probably estimate that political might or postpone many of the adverse of German They probably calculate that they have strong for and supporting the resistance to Authority in West They remilitarization probably believe as West be comes able to pursue a more independent it may become a disruptive in the Western and that the West Ger themselves would in consequence be more to consider to their association with the They may con side the Star and other will lead to of bad faith on both sides and to a breakdown of between these two The Soviet lead ers may also believe that the political legion of West under the in fluency of armament and the eventual pass ing of from the undergo favorable to their They may calculate that these will in swinging the internal political balance in toward either the Left or or both and that the con sequence may be a political climate more favorable to the alternative which Soviet policy can pose for the In we believe that the Soviet would take a most serious view of both the political and military of ratification for their but that they would nevertheless consider that the potent till threat involved would not emerge at an early date and that there would remain time for possible would also exclude major which could provide the basis of a German settle with the Western In conjunction with this general of we do not believe that there would be any fundamental shift in the Soviet public but the might for adopt a more menacing In view of the vigorous campaign they have made against the Soviet would probably take some of the they have notably the renunciation of the with the Up and and the establish of an East defensive They might even invoke the of the Mutual Assistance Treaty of The Soviet may believe that gains particularly in may though by no offset the loss of Soviet prestige and power in They probably will intensify to conclude a peace treaty with offering favorable to encourage neutrality not only in that but also to nitrate to the the of an accommodation with the They will of course continue their to isolate the Up on the of and the offshore or any other in on which the Western allies do not have a firm PROBABlE SOVIET Of ACTION We believe it that the initial Soviet response to ratification of the would be based on the assumption that the security of the was immediately We believe that the would take to prove its military would employ all political and subversive to prevent or impede armament in West and to obstruct its with its Western part and would attempt to compensate else under of limited for the accretion to Western strength resulting from West German This gen real pattern of response would exclude a mile try action in the Soviet would involve substantial risk of general It Attitude Toward on Ger We believe it unlikely that the would participate in on for some time after The loss of prestige which the would suffer by reversing the strong stand it taken against the possibility of after ratification would in itself move the Soviet against such a Never the Soviet recognize that the German desire for unity will persist and as long as the the capability to grant or withhold it may be able to inhibit the pace and reduce the scale of German armament through or the promise of For these rea we believe that the would be will after an to negotiate further on Authority T it is highly unlikely that the would agree to German unification on that would be acceptable to Since we estimate that the Soviet response to ratification would not include any which would entail substantial risk of we do not believe that the Soviet lead ers would take strong to force the Western out of in view of the new situation in Ger many by they would regard the Western position in Berlin as politically even more intolerable than West Berlin border would probably be to strengthen security in East Ger many and East There would probe by be some harassment of Western access to the city by way of Western determine nation to maintain the Berlin Such might be associated with an East Ger man program to build up and would probably be carried out by the East German In consequence there is likely to be some increase of tension over Berlin in the period immediately following We that the Soviet would be concerned not to allow such a situation to get out of In the initial period following ratification the Soviet of zonal for may zonal and even threaten to partition the These and would probably be based on that ratification of the Agree would be by to convert western into a area and would increase the likelihood of with We believe it how that the Soviet would permit any such to go beyond the stage of demon or that they would take any course which would limit their freedom of action in the issue for future with the Bloc Defense Among the which the would probably take to improve its military posture would be the creation of the joint command structure for Eastern forecast at the recent cow conference of Bloc Although the already effective indirect control of Satellite military the Soviet military would probably find it advantageous in the interest of readiness and efficiency to put these on an open These formal defensive would pro able be by an additional arrangement restricted to and East as the most directly by West German rear The structure thus would probably be by Soviet prop panda as the nucleus of a security organization open to participation by all mean We also believe it possible that the would strengthen Soviet in the in East Satellite may likewise be The East German are likely to be un veiled as a national military establishment and possibly by the introduction of The would probably accelerate the strengthening of its own armed if Ger man armament of successful we see no even in the most recent Soviet of an intention to begin an early rapid of Soviet armed The budgetary allocation to defense may be in part a demonstrate measure intended lend substance to Soviet that of the would increase the danger of Since the Soviet probably believe that ratification of the a potential rather than an immediate threat to Soviet we believe that Soviet policy will continue to emphasize qualitative improvement rather than enlargement of its military If at any stage in the process of simple meeting the the various of action above did in the Soviet sufficiently offset the develop ing threat of German we believe the Soviet would almost certainly take further in the attempt to counter this accretion to the strength of the Authority These would include primarily a sharp of Soviet and Satellite military They might also include more threatening of action against or in the Far or with the pur pose of rousing fear of nuclear war in the West and causing Western to demand that their follow a cautious We believe at this the of action than it had but would avoid those which in its judgment clearly the probably of general ALTERNATIVE SOVIET Of ACTION It is possible that the Soviet may at any time decide they cannot offset the threat of German rear In this they would be con fronted with two broad to undertake an early showdown with the West em on this possibly the use of force grave of gen real to attempt to negotiate a settle in which both Western and Soviet would be withdrawn and a unified would be with area We believe that under currently prevail ing the would reject the first We continue to estimate that the would finally decide that gen real war was too hazardous a gamble and would endanger the survival of the Soviet There remains the possibility that at some stage the Soviet would agree to settle the German problem by simultaneous with draw of Western and Soviet and run fiction by an electoral process acceptable to the Western The might see certain in a unified if it could be kept with its under international As against ing no control over the armament of West the might thus hope to ex together with the Western some measure of control over the of a united Such an arrangement would necessitate the withdrawal of Up from and possibly result in large of Up armed strength in the rest of It would allow freed from the of occupation and a large armament to intensify economic competition with other of Western and might lead to in those for a reduction of their own burden of The fact that the had agreed to such a settlement might in itself tend to stimulate the for

comic instability of and to render them incapable of decisive action by fostering and exploit ing neutrality and within and among to bring about the withdrawal of Up power from its present advanced bases around the periphery of map Authority I the to impede or offset the re armament of West and its association with the Western and to death Japan from the sphere of Western influence and encourage

ordered an imminent threat se general war might occur during the period of this estimate as the climax of a series of and counter by either which neither side originally intended to lead to general We believe that the despite the growth of its nuclear capability ing the period of this continue to try to avoid substantial risk of general since the Soviet will probably still not be confident that they could attack the Up with nuclear out the to more devastating as their nuclear Soviet may come to estimate that the because of fear for itself or for its or because by its will be increasingly deferred from in a nuclear They may there fore come to believe that local will be less likely than at present to expand into general and thus that superior Bloc military in certain local can be without substance till risk of provoking general We believe that Soviet diplomacy ing the period of this estimate Will not directed toward a general settlement be teen the and the It will al most

moving friction in the of Japan with the Up and encouraging It is that the Soviet also a substantial and pro reduction in international ten that would not only armament but also further their other Up withdrawal from advanced bases and a reduction of the incentive for the West to maintain its present defense The Soviet lead ers may also feel that such a reduction of international is desirable cause of the pressure their own inter The principal objective of Soviet in is to obtain a solution of the German problem favorable to Soviet in Prevention or down of West German armament and blocking the

with the recent Soviet on disarmament and the cur rent to may indicate a Soviet in the course of fur to give up control of East in exchange for a guard seed naturalization of a united and a Soviet

problem of younger protege become the of policy likely to develop during the period of this present hard the resolution of may sharper the struggle for personal We continue to that the over personal power and policy will be to the small group at the apex of the power structure and will not result in open violence the police or military We do not believe that the police or military are likely

and which it to The Soviet view of the world situation is affected by their Communist ideology and by their isolation from the general of world It is of particular importance Soviet of there to take into account the fact that outside the Communist Orbit or in between the and the West may frequently have for the Soviet a meaning quite different that which they The ideological of the remains a principal determinant of the Soviet view of m the world The Soviet still view world in of an irreconcilable conflict between the of Communism and Capitalism which win continue until Communism throughout the In large this view both deter their and colors of and We believe that the validity of the of Communist ideal in Soviet been confirmed in the main by the course of in the war and postwar THE POSTWAR BACKGROUND Soviet towards the end of World War In that a situation favor able to Communist expansion in a large part of the Hence they their advantage as fast and as far as they could in expanding the Communist sphere and extending Soviet After some time their progress in and ran against increasing opposition as the world gradually The Soviet are probably aware that it was the advance of Soviet power in Central and in that forth an increasingly stubborn Western contraction and console Western Beginning in and at an accelerated rate after the Western built up their power and cohesion to the point where further Comma list expansion in and even in some of could no longer be accomplished without risk of general At the same an accommodation with the even if the had wished came to depend upon so costly to the power position that the Soviet clearly them as with a world situation ly inhospitable to their the Soviet have sought to find middle way the of war or accommodation at unacceptable They have on the assumption that both Western fear of war and hope for peace could be to advance Soviet a policy of alternating menace and reconciliation was adopted to encourage the view in the West that Soviet expansionism would model aged if the Western from in their own defense which the This policy no abandonment of expansionism nor any cessation of Communist agree at least where such aggression could be carried out without grave risk of general In the period after Soviet policy to place relatively more emphasis on the element of silly in some degree because of the of Soviet internal but apparently mainly in the belief that for an interim period at least such tactics were more likely to weak en Western THE SOVIET Of CURRENT DEVELOPMENT The Soviet probably believe that the Up remains firm in its intention to oppose Communist and that it to T a r s E c R E Authority SECRET persist in its effort to bring all important strategic peripheral to the Bloc into closer linkage with the Up defense They probably also estimate that the Up is unlikely deliberately to initiate general war during the next few The Soviet probably believe due to their increasing nuclear a situation is approaching in which a general war use by both sides of would bring about such extensive destruction as to threaten the survival of both Western civilization and the Soviet They probably estimate that a situation of mutual deterrence could develop in which each side would be strongly from general war or taking which it as materially increasing the of general they probably estimate that the us would not be by fear of the of general full military if that its security was The Soviet almost mainly believe that overt armed aggression by Bloc against any state formally allied with the Up would result in the employment of Up military power as necessary to counter such They probably also estimate that such aggression against a state not for mall to the Up would involve risk of Up military but that the of this and the the us would depend upon the importance to the Up of the country the of the and the political situation with in the Up and world The Soviet probably recognize that the success of the Up effort to prevent further expansion heavy ly upon the ability of the Up to establish and maintain cohesion in the Some of the last such as the failure of the Western to present a united front at the Geneva their subsequent inability to associate more with the defense of South east and the unwillingness of most West and to support Up policy to ward Communist may indicate to the Soviet a decline in Up ability to main tain such They probably believe that the influence of will continue to and that it may become the leader of a group of capable of an role in world They may also believe that and Japan will become increasingly capable of taking an independent On the other they probably now recognize that certain aggressive by the Soviet Bloc tend to increase the willingness of the to follow Up At the same time they there are and in which such would have the opposite While they may not expect during next few to the defection of any for allied with the they probably believe that their own can encourage friction thin the L Stern the of Up to support in of and weaken us influence among The Soviet probably believe that in the development of Western mile try strength do not present them with any immediate either of war or of a weak ending of their position in While Western nuclear will continue to this development will not alter es faced throughout the postwar More the advantage in this respect is being reduced as the its own nuclear The pro able recognize that the present rough balance of military power could be in favor of the West by the appearance of major military power in West and but they probably now believe that German or nose armament is not likely to take place on a significant scale during the next two or three at The Soviet will have noted that the trend in West military continued de spite the recent increase in their own mile try they are probably quite confident that Western military although is not now being at a rate which will permit Authority the application of substantially mile try pressure on the The Soviet have always heavily on a deterioration of undermine strength and to produce which would range the Western against each Despite the vigor of the of Western and the failure of the Up de session to materialize the Soviet are unlikely to have been shaken in view that point to eventual comic crisis in capitalist They are that the of some of critical importance to the Western such as and would probably prove vulnerable in the event of even a moderately serious decline in of The a a even in short and one if it did might produce a political which they could PROBABLE SOVIET ESTIMATE Of FUTURE DEVELOPMENT On the Soviet probably estimate that there is at present no critical threat to their and that there may be for Communist son by short of general They probably estimate that Western and unity are vulnerable to Soviet political and may become increasingly the Soviet probably believe that they can rely primarily upon political and in some military action by local to carry on their struggle the Communist the Soviet almost mainly recognize that may occur during the period of this estimate which would require a revision of this Some of the which presently con corn Soviet could develop in such a way as to present a direct So security might take a course while not Soviet se purity could height in international engage the prestige of the and cause the to revise its estimate of Western Possible which might lead the Soviet to make revision the a rate or scale of German armament greater than that presently or aggressive in as a result of influence ever within by a West Ger by Communist China which led to or imminent danger of between Communist China and the armament of Japan on a major the acquisition of offensive by and of in to vent the from gaining control of the country by military f i t SECRETe Authority PROBABLE SOVIET Of ACTION r t t f f l i J f f i r f t PRESENT SOVIET We believe that the within the sphere of Soviet power and the Soviet mate of the world situation which have been in the foregoing have led the Soviet to assess their own somewhat as the balance of mil power in the world and the increasing destructiveness of nuclear are such that general war would involve very heavy to the extending possibly to the destruction of the Soviet re On the other not so great nor the of the menacing as to from present advanced in and seem in view of the growing of Bloc and the friction with in the the Comma probably estimate that they

up economic power in the Bloc as a step toward balancing the vastly greater economic potential of the These do not imply a weakness which neglect of for expansion under of limited t r I t We believe that the Soviet will concentrate on the following principal object times during the period of this To increase the economic and military strength of the This section with Soviet teal of Soviet with respect to various internal are in preceding the In the sum mary of Soviet in the first two of internal to the and to the Soviet are To promote the political ana economic instability of and to render

advance toward their by short of general we believe that ing the period of this estimate the Kremlin will try to avoid of and to de Communist China from of which in its judgment would clearly involve substantial risk of general The Soviet are unlikely to believe that Communist or Satellite can be used in open across organized state during this period without running such a the or one of the Bloc might engage in indirect aggression or take action which would create a situation in which the Up or its rather than yield an important would take Author action which could lead to general We that the Kremlin would not be deferred by the risk of general war from taking contraction against a Western action which it considered an imminent threat to Soviet general war might occur during the period of this mate as the climax of a series of and by either which neither side originally intended to lead to general It is possible that at some time during the period of this estimate the might come to believe that world had taken a turn that would ultimately lead to a serious impairment of Soviet Such a belief might for as a result of in or in connection with an armed conflict between the Up and Communist In a situation might feel to military action in order to forestall an in deterioration of its security even though such action would entail height end risk of general We how that even under these the would seek to keep any resulting con file and to avoid general By end of the period of this estimate the will have a greatly ca ability to inflict destruction with nuclear particularly on the New the Soviet will probably still not be confident that they could attack the Up with nuclear without the to an even more devastating count We the will continue to try to avoid substantial of general war despite the increase of its nuclear as these Soviet may come to estimate that the because of fear for itself or for its or because of pressure by its will be increasingly deferred from tilting the devastation in a nuclear They may therefore come to believe that local will be less likely than at present to expand into general and thus that superior Soviet Bloc military in certain local can be that without substantial risk of provoking In diplomatic the Soviet will almost certainly try to take ad vantage of the with which Western by their bet public strive to es cape nuclear war through peaceful We believe it that in a sit nation of sharp and general international crisis the would seek to break Western determination by direct and open of nuclear The Soviet would probably fear that such tactics bring about a situation in which war would become and they might fear that they would provoke a preventive attack by the Diplomacy and Propaganda We that Soviet diplomacy during arid made important period of this estimate not be directed toward a general settlement between the and the It will almost certainly continue to combine intended to ease international with other which increase such and with cal warfare calculated to play upon the fear of At present the is engaged in very active diplomacy on a number of important Japan though no apparent important as We believe that the current Soviet dip somatic are directed primarily toward the armament of in close alliance with the and that the ground is being prepared for new Soviet pro on this perhaps at Four Power during this We also be live that in connection with the forthcoming peace treaty with Japan the is likely to make some in the hope of friction in the real of Japan with the Up and encouraging It is that the Soviet also desire a substantial and reduction in international that would not only prevent German but also further their other Authority SECRET Up withdrawal from advanced bases and a reduction of the incentive for the West to maintain its present defense The So may also feel that such a reduce of international is desirable be cause of the pressure of their own internal through technical assistance or the sponsor ship of development In some these could take the form of cal training or the sponsorship of training for foreign within the and could consequently be carried out at small We believe that the will place con winning in its diplomacy and prop panda upon for the control or about of nuclear The Soviet will probably try such to hold out to the world the prospect of release from the threat of nuclear by seeking to place upon the us the blame for failure to achieve workable control to stimulate about the reasonableness and moderation of Up in this We believe it highly unlikely that the during the period of this estimate will agree to plan which would inspection the under acceptable to the Western Soviet regarding the control of nuclear ons will probably be designed primarily to erect and moral bar to Up freedom of action in the use of nuclear Trade and Technical Assistance Basic Soviet economic and the of which the non Communist world is willing to accept from

most vol notable to this form of political in the would probably be in the Soviet might be willing accept certain economic for political gains in of prime strategic such as or In any they will almost

Soviet policy in during the period of this estimate will be to obtain a solution of the German problem favorable to Soviet mention or down of West German re armament and blocking the development of West with the have first The Soviet pro able recognize that three principal West are to West German armament at and probably estimate any direct Soviet attempt to foster among them with the aim of halting the implementation of the would They recognize that man in apprehension concerning German rear will remain and may even sharper ing the next few but they know that alone does not have the power to stop West German armament once it The West do have this and the Soviet pro able believe that the desire for unity will make West susceptible to within the power of to the will almost mainly make great to influence the sit nation in West It will al most certainly increase propaganda and po political warfare designed to encore age the sentiment in West Beyond the will probably seek to

upon a course of the Soviet would have to weigh the which they could bring to bear in the struggle against those which would be opposed to and the to their own regime of a possible global war with the

for a West German government to reject a fide offer from the for a genuinely unified at the price of naturalization in the event it were DISCUSSION THE Of In SOVIET POSTWAR POLICY The policy in since been eyed to its policy in Eastern Eu rope and to the of the struggle for particularly the question of future Except silly for a short period after World War was probably not seriously by Soviet as an

Western been an important center for international must front and the occupy for Communist and control of Communist elsewhere in the staining of Soviet in shielded southern and west from Western influence and thus enhanced the security of the new must in those Authority AND Of THE TREATY The which the accepted in the treaty involve important con sessions as with previous In the the most ly significant concession is the liquidation of Soviet property in The ma for political concession is the Soviet agree to withdraw occupation prior to a German Taking only economic into consider the the treaty are less ad advantageous to the than either the con situation of the occupation or a treaty which included the economic of the draft obviously accepted by the Western Under the Article the would have permanent ownership in certain oil and shipping and exploitation in oil In the present treaty the agreed to the following of property by it as former Ger man return some enter to for payment of million in goods instead of to accept de livery of one million of crude oil annually for in place of to oil which have been between two and three million to re turn to oil and oil district button which the would have outright under Article and to for all assets of the Dance Shipping Company in assigned by Article to the The political and i military of the present agreement on troop withdrawal from can also be as giving less advantage to the than the which the Western had previously they might At Berlin once in the West willingness to extend the period for troop withdrawal to after the signature of a and Premier subsequently pro extending the period to two Un the of the the agreed to withdraw its by ber at the Most the agreed to separate the question of troop withdrawal from any prior agreement among four regarding By so it a counter it might have been able to employ seeking a revision of Western in Ger There are a number of compensating which probably reduce the scope and significance of these from the So the economic point of From the value of the now to be returned to un the and there are that of these have been de oil have been reduced under Soviet the extent of the concession involved in their return to is In the for redemption ex tending for in the case of oil prop and six for other will continue to give the some influence over economic to From a military the with draw of Western from and the denial to of any possible use it might have made of Western in its defense may be by the as more than any in its own withdrawal from Eastern The neutrality of combined with that of will in verdict the most direct route through the Alpine from to and thus interrupt the continuous Western front from to The presence of Soviet in Eastern to assure border security and Soviet control in and is probably less important to the now than in the early after the war when Communist control had not been fully The legal requirement in the and mania peace that Soviet be re from those after the con inclusion of the can be Authority by other such as the recently Eastern mile try PROBABLE SOVIET AND While there are some in the of the treaty to the they do hot adequately explain Soviet mo times in seeking a treaty at this In they fail to explain why the is willing to accept a treaty on less ad advantageous than it might have obtain answer to these must be elsewhere than in the of the treaty We believe that it was the development of the German and in particular the progress toward West armament and inclusion in which led to the Soviet decision to con an treaty at this How other may have a role in a pattern of mixed Soviet even prior to had apparently the need for some relaxation of international partly to arrest the growing cohesion of Western al and partly to slow the pace and re due the burden of the arms We be live that Soviet for an interim will probably continue this attempt to hold international in The move for an taken in the context of the progress toward German armament and the threatening crisis in the Far can be as part of this On the other it is also possible that the train treaty is the first step in a series of designed to produce a substantial and relaxation in international tension in order not only to prevent West German re armament but to further other Soviet Up withdrawal from ad and a reduction of the incentive for the West to maintain its present defense We believe that the as much emphasis upon aggressive as upon con and that aggressive anti are unlikely to be abandoned over any Soviet policy to be showing its conciliatory and the fact that the treaty move would document this may have been con ordered by the Soviet as an additional factor in its It also been that the an increase of the Far and possibly even between the Up and Communist and is there fore to exploit the of a conciliatory posture in Such an it is would not only place the in a favorable position to prevent its own involvement in such but would also increase its ability to influence the to try to restrain Up against Communist We believe it is possible that in the present stage of the crisis in the Strait the may have some such but we think it unlikely that this would have been an factor in the Soviet move for an train Another important Soviet active in the Far East is to death Japan from its present alliance with the It is thus possible that the Soviet on the eve of the treaty it would be useful to demonstrate to the a case in which Soviet cones were obtainable at the price of accept ing A further hypothesis on Soviet in moving for an treaty is that the to erect a bloc of neutral in Central Such a bloc would suitably include and the It would also necessarily include either unified or as an essential The likelihood that this may have a role in Soviet must be in the context of the Ger man problem as a We believe that the only development meeting Soviet security so signify castle as to explain the reversal of a Soviet policy at this time is the culmination of defense ar in the agreement to rear West Authority and include it in German armament and association with long been by the as a serious potential threat to the security of the Soviet The development of the German issue over the last few particularly at the Berlin Foreign meeting of and that the could no longer merely by tempo sizing oil delay Western to include a West in the Western The swift negotiation and ratification of the subsequent to the failure of apparently came as a surprise to the Soviet and convinced them that unless Soviet policy departed from some of its rigid West German re armament and association with the West would go We that the reversal of policy on trial is designed to regain the initiative for the Along with other it is intend to convey the impression that the from the rigidity of its former and is prepared to approach discus on international with a new flex The immediate objective is to en courage hope in the and particularly in that exist for a settlement of the German The will attempt to convince the West that they must abandon rear if they are to obtain Soviet agreement to It will also portray the success of the as an ex ample of the that the West could expect from direct with the Beyond the almost certainly the treaty as an urgent oratory step for another Four Power It is unlikely that the would expand the valuable diplomatic and logical leverage which its position in given it simply to effect a temporary pact on Western The can not expect that the example of an treaty unaccompanied by concrete So on will sustain Ger man for reunification The Soviet probably believe that fur plausible on their part to reach a German settlement must be made if the ex listing sentiment in West is to be turned to The acceptance of an treaty on more generous than the West had together with the recent Soviet move on dis is therefore probably designed to create a receptive atmosphere for which the will wish to advance at a Four Power A principal objective of Soviet policy in a Four Power conference will probably be to fix the responsibility for the continued div son of upon Western armament The Soviet would hope there by to encourage West German opposition to policy of find alignment with the designed to effect this aim might include any of a number of on plan advanced at the Berlin Con reference in for an system of collective The plan could be seated in more attractive guise and to appeal to various in the but essentially it would probably call for a recon nation of the status quo in with the issue of unification being left for solution by two German The So objective in such a maneuver would be to present an alternative solution of the Ger man question so attractive as to offset the an Western demand that agreement on free must precede any re grading status in The Soviet would count upon the effect of the treaty on Western opinion to lend plausibility to their two We believe it unlikely that the Soviet estimate that the West would agree to any proposal In making such a the Soviet aim would be to shift the focus of attention from the issue of free to the issue of rear as the principal obstacle to a German and thus to gain a propaganda advantage over the West which the could exploit in its with West

in public desire for a reduction of in international and for the use of all possible even those the themselves may to work towards a settlement with the Communist there is public pressure on to find some of and especial ly some of that nuclear will not be used in Evidence from the that the Soviet are well aware of the nature and the power of nuclear which had generally been publicly in We believe that they deeply concerned by the cation of these Up nuclear almost certainly constitute a major deterrent to overt military agree son by the As nuclear further in and the of mutual devastation the to can and compromise presently discern in will probably be A version to of for and fear of general will almost mainly be more marked than The of policy against the Communist such as will probably be and the may become greater of a weakening of the by successive At the same time the Soviet because of their recognition of the dev effects of nuclear will still almost certainly be concerned not to J Authority aggressive to the point of substantial risk of general teen nuclear devastation and neutral we believe that practically all would choose We believe that the allies of the especially the

superior Bloc military in certain local can be without substantial of pro voting general DISCUSSION OPINION CONCERNING NUCLEAR During the past year public concern about nuclear considerably in most of

frequently issue of the biology and genetic which might arise from continued experimentation with I I I nuclear The public been the recipient of accurate information which is and of misinformation which is Its reaction varied in intensity from time to time and from country to but a few clear and powerful have among the people of nearly all the principal of the The first of these is an fear of This feeling is general rather than it is fear of war in principle rather than panic from a clear and present Most people appear to believe that general Authority war is not likely within the next few their aversion to as it is by consciousness of the appalling power of nuclear abnormally strong opposition to of action which present even a minor risk of and sup port for of action which offer even a hope of however If general war imminent these popular in the could be a ma for factor in government A second trend in mass vigorously by the is one of grow ing opposition to the and use of nuclear According to in Western an overwhelming majority of the people favor an agreement the fracture of all nuclear is even significant popular support for vague to the without ade quote that the would serve the In West and the poll a substantial minority of opinion against the employment of nuclear even in the assumed circumstance that invasion and occupation of the country could be in no other and that the would be used only against mile try The also indicate that there is little public recognition in Western of the importance of nuclear to Western defense and little realize that the military of con template use of such In opposing the use of nuclear little distinction is made between and There is a great deal of feeling that the next combat use of nuclear of whatever size and for whatever would forthwith break inhibition which now exist and which might otherwise prevent any use of such there is a feeling that of nuclear would These were taken in late and early in the West and They were by competent age and gave considered to be accurate within a margin of plus or minus six carry grave risk of turning a small war into general This feeling to be based in part on the ground that use of a weapon of such unprecedented power would surely provoke retaliation and on an ascending It also to stem from some of the more concerning modern which give the impression that any limitation of the scope or area of air would be militarily un Together with the broad of public opinion concerning nuclear more complex and are by or in and generally Perhaps the most widespread of these is that general war will never again force of nu clear made it so obviously un A variant of this is the idea that even if general war should nuclear would not be used because the would not be disposed to invoke the almost unlimited destruction that their use would Contrary are also freely It is that nuclear destructive as they now constitute merely another item in the arsenal of a military es and must be considered as of It is pointed out that general war is apt to happen by miscalculation as by and that con of profitability may not be the decisive factor in its The deterrent value of nuclear is generally by the even by those who do not think that it is so great as to make general war out of the It is widely that the over helping nuclear superiority of the Up in the past been an important deterrent to the aggressive of the and thus an important protection to the of free As Soviet nuclear grow the picture but Western nu clear continue to be considered as a deterrent to major Soviet military agree These constitute an important check on the critical the t Authority which are assiduously by We do not believe official or educated opinion in any major nation presently an without adequate guard It is probable that most informed is tending to the conclusion that control of nuclear by inspection is technical ly and that to be time would have to be of a different I I The intensity of public feeling about nu and the extent of greatly in various of the In Japan were almost to hysteria at the time of the accidental on a fishing from the Bikini in no other country of the world have there been so many highly some cooler more against exist once and the testing and the use of nuclear In the Up there been pro found much almost uniquely in the western a definite attempt at guidance from the by In the other of Western agitation been somewhat and the level of debate much than in the Among the neutrality the degree of concern on subject of nuclear though this been more evident on official than among the general It is early notable that vigorous condemnation of nuclear in involved more of feeling against the Up than against the In the Bloc there until lately teen comparatively little diffusion of in about the nature of nuclear weak the Soviet regime begun to make some information avail at first for a largely since but later to the general The government not

New there is no reason to doubt that in the Communist the people fear nu clear insofar they understand should also be what such noted that the Communist within as well as outside their own have given publicity to of the peaceful of atomic and to of the to be derived from such if the can be within the entire Bloc the effective ness of popular in ornamental is Public discussion of nuclear by the highest Communist been comparatively During the peri od the military significance of these was generally probably the Communist initially desired to min the importance of a weapon they did not possess and subsequently to deny that the possession of greater nuclear gave the Up a decisive military In March declared in a notable speech that a nuclear war would lead to the destruction of civilian both Communist and This view since been officially and em practically by the Communist lead The Soviet now assert that nuclear war would involve the de destruction only of capitalist while Communism would survive even though badly were the first public by So of the terrible power of the new It may be that their own some part in this expressed anti We believe that the Soviet though not the Soviet are now well Authority acquainted with the nature of nuclear weak and are deeply concerned about their INFLUENCE Of NUCLEAR Of CURRENT NATIONAL The influence of nuclear on current national is best considered in the context of two other which linguist the present era of international re The first of these in the char after of the Communist movement and of the of the Process ing as they do a belief in the eventual tri of Communism throughout the and in their mission to strive toward this tri the Communist characterize their relation to the world as one of unremitting and permanent hostile Coexistence can be for them only aggression is a duty when it can be with good chance of When one party to a quarrel this the of adjustment and compromise between become difficult and even conflict is stability is only but there still remains the of what form the conflict may The second the of world the division of the world into two with almost no nation of military consequence left outside the As a result of this division there is a great rigidity and lack of room for maneuver in international al There is no third force of sup ancient strength to manipulate and perhaps alter the balance of international The of lesser have come increasing ly to involve the conflicting of the two great power The danger that small will grow into general war is great er than it was when power was more evenly distributed in the and restraint on the part of the great is the only effective influence which may act to prevent a war of limited from becoming a general To a considerable degree the existence of nuclear to accentuate the polarization of for no nation or group of can pretend to constitute a strong third force without possessing such in together with adequate delivery the primary signify dance of these is not that they have the of the current but rather that they have enormously the potential likeness of the which are likely to arise out of that this fact flow practically all the which nuclear exert on national at the The most important effect of the nuclear situation on the current national of most is to diminish the willingness of their and of even though it is virtually impossible to protect the inter of free in the present world with out running such A second effect is to increase public desire for a reduction of in international and for the use of all possible even those which the themselves may consider ill to work towards a general settlement with the Communist there is public pressure on to find some of and specially some of that nuclear will not be used Desire for disarmament is of course no new it is and dignified at how by the fear of nuclear weak These do of hold true in equal measure for all For Nationalist South and perhaps they do not seem to hold true at The great is whether they operate on the Communist ers to approximately the same degree that they do on We believe that both Soviet and must desire to avoid substantial of general and that this desire in great measure from their recognition of sig superior Up nuclear and of the probable of nuclear to They probably also believe that overt military over national or would present substantial of general and we therefore believe they will avoid such aggression in the It may that the do not to the same degree and small tend to The also may count heavily on willingness of and to risk general war as a the tendency of small We believe that such Of view could hold grave for the I Few current national are traceable exclusively to the existence of nuclear weak These include primarily in mil and Most important are the manufacture of nuclear its creation of for these against distant and its to construct a more lair defense Along with this have came in the equipment and doctrine of Soviet largely for the of them to the of nuclear With the same end in view the for reducing the size and increasing the mobility of their ground The Up is great ly attention to the problem of de ending the against air and for the first time given the share of military to the A notable act of policy directly related to the situation is the decision to make their own thermonuclear This decision had the approval of the of both and of the nation gen that of these the most deterrent to an attack by the on the United and that if such an attack was to be averted it would almost mainly have to be primarily through such torrent force rather than through the ons and of he declared that the Up could not expect to ex much influence upon the of other if dependent for its de upon the deterrent power of Up he that while the could rely on the Up as an ally if war they could not be certain that the war of the Up would include such an employment of thermonuclear as would be most effective for the defense of We believe it virtually certain that Up nuclear constitute a major deter rent to overt military aggression by the Apart from this we cannot estimate with con evidence the effects of the nuclear sit nation on current Soviet It does seem likely that Up nuclear are primarily responsible for the present con cilia tory of Soviet policy or for such as the agreement to withdraw from We though it is not that the Soviet are seriously concerned about the prospect of a Western armed at some future date not only with conventional but with nuclear as On May the new disarmament which departed from some of its previous on the Soviet motivation in advancing these is probably highly and we cannot yet estimate whether there is a direct relation between them and Soviet concern over posse nuclear PROBABLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT If the nuclear of the Up and the continue to develop along present and adequate are not each nation will acquire and sufficient to destroy progressively all the important of the The exact degree to which such destruction might be carried would be related to the of action which each side felt to In a general war situation vent or such of action to be or would probably be initially compare tensile for both sides even if dissimilar in Authority many Therefore destruction could as far as to eliminate progressively source of all important of action Such destruction could kill large proportion of both destroy principal and at least put an end to coherent and organ This destruction extended to the and both major if one side should be able rapidly to prevent or the most critical of the other the over all destruction to be to both sides be reduced national Version to of for disarm agent and for and and fear of general would almost mainly be more marked then than The of policy against such as the Soviet would pro able and the increase of a weak ending of the position by massive At the same time the Soviet because of their recognition of the devastating effects of nu clear will still certainly be concerned not to pursue aggressive to the point of risk of general We do not undertake to in this how far the defense of the two and their might be able to cut down this gross capability for mutual Some competent predict that an attack by either side on the other inevitably result in the of regardless of defense or the degree of surprise in the initial If such a view generally accepted nuclear war would appear to be al most but of the for no nation is likely to seek inevitable We think it much more that there will ways be a considerable element of doubt about the matter in the Up and the if not in Certainty of destruction is to be There will pro able appear on each side to be a only a slim of surviving as an festive national entity while the de destruction of the It inherit that both the Up and the would have to expect a degree of devastation unparalleled in and that lesser nation involved in the conflict might have to expect if the Up or considered them important they would suffer something preaching total destruction of national ex Over the very long the trend of development will probably further sharper the advantage of tactical Under such the public and above and evident today would probably be I I We believe that the allies of the and especially the major will continue in the at least as long as war does appear Their for do ing so would to keep their un the protection of Up to contribute to a force sufficient to deter the from and to be in a position to exert influence on the of the Up and of other of the all Under the new they would probably try to increase their influence over Up Many of them would even more vigorously than at present counsel can urge and advise the avoid of particularly if their own vital were not They would be aware that the Up itself was for the first time exposed to major devastation if it in in general and they might consider that the Up would therefore be somewhat to influence in the direction of caution than it had sometimes previously to This disposition to caution would be find if the conviction grew that the and the Up both so clearly the trousers of general war that they would be constrained to avoid it even if they in in In these there would be a listening of the fear of general war and a much greater flex ability in international There would be greater willingness to accept the Authority t l i were directly of small especially by the It conceivable that in time there might even be Willingness to accept limited employment of clear in such if it were certain that the risk of general war was Another development which could alter international situation would be the of significant nuclear by of in addition to the Up and The are already building their strength in this The Can West and some other clearly have the scientific and capacity to do although the effort It is thus possible that in be decade or nuclear may be k much more widely distributed among they are at The of such It a development cannot be almost that the rating influence of the Up and the would be somewhat Whether the allies of the Up would remain allies if general war imminent or The tally is leading to war might be such that some of allies had no and not remain even if they wished to do Or they might be such that most of the a con ordered the at stake insufficient to risk general and therefore themselves neutral at an early stage of the Some might es image that nuclear war between the Up and the would end with complete or destruction of the ing potential of both and therefore that neutrality might be both a safe and a profitable If in such a way as to confront with a clear and immediate choice between nuclear devastation and we believe that practically all would choose As nuclear the will have a greatly capability to in flint particularly on the Up it the Soviet will probably still not be confident that they could attack the Up with nuclear without the to an even more ing We that the will continue to to avoid sub spatial of general war despite the in crease of its nuclear as these may come to estimate that the because of fear for itself or for its or because of sure by its will be increasingly deferred from nuclear They may therefore to believe that local will be less likely than at present to expand into general and thus that superior Bloc military in certain local can be without substantial risk of pro voting general the Soviet In diplomatic will almost certainly try to take ad vantage of the with which Western by their better informed public will strive to escape nuclear war through peaceful We believe it likely that in a situation of sharp and general international crisis the would seek to undermine Western determine by of the of the employment of nuclear We believe it that the would make open and direct of nuclear attack since Soviet would pro able fear that such tactics might bring about a situation in which general war would be come and they might even fear that they would provoke a preventive attack by the us

they could reach any point Map SOVIET OR In Present Soviet for large scale air attack on the continental Up are limited by the small number of operation al heavy and by the relatively undeveloped base in the and other Soviet arctic They are probably also limited by the lack of a flight refueling Although there is a lack of sufficient evidence to permit a firm assessment of the of individual bases in the j I Authority for staging bomber we believe that by a major the would be capable of a maximum of about aircraft from these bases in an initial attack against the Up in If all were to approximately might reach Up target not considering combat We believe it almost tain that the is psychologically capable of If flight refueling were available and used about of the aircraft would probably be and about would be In this case strike aircraft might reach tar get not considering Some of these aircraft would probably be used for electronic or If the to utilize all available those in the Basic East German and and thus lessen its of surprise it could launch a maximum of approximately aircraft oil an initial attack on the the great bulk of these aircraft would have to fix Not considering combat approximately might reach target the Assuming of against the con tin en tal the would have available about for against key Up over and military and for for other About could be immediately against key Up overseas and Not considering combat approximately might reach target In some portion of the attack or jet light currently estimate to be available could be used for at against within their opera radius of about nautical SOVIET In By we estimate that the will have operational about jet heavy and heavy and could have a considerable insight refueling thus giving it much greater flexibility in on the us interior bases be By we estimate that the by a major have sub spatially the capacity of the air bases in the and If the did in fact increase the capacity of these base and to above as staging bases it could initially against the all medium and heavy in mission If all were to thus the number of mission about might reach target not considering combat exercise of this maximum ability would the expenditure on of most of the Soviet We consider it more likely that if tanker aircraft were available the would employ even if it in substantially mission In an optimum initial the might launch about and Authority I I SECRET about mission Of the about might be from the from northeast and from interior About might in target not considering combat Even under these cond total about of Soviet bomber force would be on A ber of these mission aircraft would pro able be used electronic or diversionary the If by decided to use only and BAR in an initial attack on the could

para graph and the commitment of all heavy bomber aircraft against the the would have medium bomb ers about of which would be immediately available for attack against key Up overseas and military or for other We also estimate that in about jet light will be available for on within their operational SOVIET OR THE Of ATTACK Throughout the period of this mate the probably employ other of the Up or

capable of some Up overseas install with In add up to of the could employ and ground and could attack Up with standard C and nerve Clandestine attack on the Up itself by biological and placement of

employment of or amphibious would enable the to attack other Soviet ground and behind the for ward DISCUSSION AVAILABILITY Of SOVIET MASS DESTRUCTION Nuclear The Soviet atomic en directed primarily toward the production of nuclear will continue to receive special emphasis through The had tested by the end of small and and thermonuclear to produce an Yield up to of The series stockpile in the range and development in the but there was no further development in the During the immediate the of stockpile will probably have the general and of already tested al though the quantity of the large yield type could be produced would probably be lim item the of technological as of the end of Soviet military will govern the allocation of available fashionable material to various of with consideration probably being given more to operational than to the total energy yield In order to provide an example of Soviet stockpile we have assumed of is lived in to is in medium yield composite and the plutonium is divided equally between and small yield For of See IE Restricted Soviet Atomic Energy for of Soviet nuclear energy and of of nuclear to per determination of the aircraft which they can be prison this allocation of fashionable material is carried through If the Soviet stockpile were in this manner it would be as due to continued nuclear other trial might become more likely The probably continue work on as well as on and We estimate that by the could have with of from T to T or Such would permit more flexibility in the use of nuclear Assuming on the part of the one of the ways in which their stockpile could be divided would be as to to to There is no direct information on the na true of the Soviet control organization and for and district of nuclear we be live that Soviet nuclear will be handled by a special organization within the In view of the range of error applicable to the estimate of Soviet fashionable material product the actual for end of may be as much as lower or higher than the given Uncertainty as are into the future and the actual figure for may be as low as or as high as twice the In the Authority I Ministry of Defense and will be at both a few large storage and a large number of smaller These small will probably be at or near air missile and other delivery vehicle in advanced Radiological It is most unlike for technological that the will be able to stockpile militarily significant of radiological warfare during the period of this How the significance of radioactive following large nuclear should be considered in connection with Soviet to produce in the negation The is in of all the basic knowledge the of most By and the Soviet festive dissemination chose to do they would be able to produce By and for dissemination in adequate Although there is some evidence to indicate the is engaged in a By agent production not been either as to location or Since it is not feasible to stockpile large quan of most By in age moot would have to be directly front Chemical We assume that the stockpile of standard and munitions during World War In been and will be available for In intelligence that the could have been at least one of the nerve since and we estimate that the is capable of nerve DELIVERY Of CONVENTIONAL AND MASS DESTRUCTION By AIRCRAFT Strength of Soviet Aviation In Soviet Aviation will have an authorized strength of piston medium BADGER jet medium ISO jet heavy heavy and BAR piston The es limited actual strength of this bomber force in will be and up to ISO and BAR All are based in Western except the Air with an sized strength of which is in the Far No substantial change the strength of approximately aircraft is between now and We estimate that the probably not introduce into operational through any bomber which have not already either in or in prototype stage The appearance during of as at for the air show a significant increase in Soviet heavy production over that obviously The ISO was first seen insight in the spring of and considered as a prototype at that With the appear of BIOS and BAR at this we conclude that production on the ISO about the first production model was produced in the first quarter of and approximately will have been produced by Present evidence that it is being produced at Plant in It is that the could achieve a maximum peak rate of per month at this plant by It is more due to associated with supply of and training of personnel for accept in operating that a production rate of about per month would be It is also possible that other could now be the ISO and that the Throughout this actual have been used for while have been used for Actual air craft should be considered In at Soviet attack the real of actual aircraft to Is subject to con variance and cannot be accurately listed for future By actual strength will probably equal Authority production rate could be as high as per Similar analysis of BAR production not been made at this The could have up to BIOS

the basic navigational of celestial navigate and radio it is that Soviet Aviation is train film in the use of more advanced and Although we have no evidence of long range training at mental some

PROBABLE SOVIET OR Of THE Up Present for attack on the con tin en tal Up are limited by the real timely small of operational and the relatively undeveloped in forward They are also probably limited by the lack of a insight refueling The forward base will continue to be important during the period of this but as the number of BAR the forward base will be less important in determine ing the number of aircraft which could be at one in an intercontinental The increase of the ISO and BAR heavy continued Long Range Aviation training develop of an flight refueling capability and extensive improvement of the forward staging would result in a substantial increase in Soviet for attack on the Up by Base The the ability of its entire bomb er force against the United from bases within at the of the period this could be done only if bases in the German area were used in addition to those within the This area is not a likely choice for initial strike because of the probable loss of surprise during oversight of Western territory and the greater likelihood that in this area would be de should the under take after an initial surprise inter continental this area might be Use of the Central Arctic area is also to be severely limited because of high ly unfavorable weather and logistic but might be used for small ers of The area is also unlikely to be used for initial in because of the involved

these three forward base to the point together with in the they could simultaneously launch the entire bomber If were used for refueling the number of strike aircraft which could be from these would be The employment of flight refueling with the ISO would permit the use of a number of interior particularly in the Aircraft The principal aircraft used for intercontinental between and would probably be the and At the beginning of the period medium bomber would probably be the principal air craft used for this It would pro able continue to be so until the ISO and BAR appear in because of range advantage over the We mate that the would employ the AD GER medium jet bomber only for special inter continental under in which the use of high speed and high alt against particular was con ordered The BADGER would require flight refueling even for for coverage of the most important industrial of the but the BADGER in by will able have adequate range on to cover these without insight refueling

within an arc through and From Kola the ISO could under the same condition barely reach the northern tip of refueling and dog to avoid and BIOS on from the area could reach and lower On the same type

choice of bases and Particularly advantageous would be the ability to employ compatible from interior in order to hit a in the Up with ISO type aircraft oil the would have to employ refueling and forward staging The BAR heavy bomber on with a pound bomb load could strike any point in the Up from interior provided direct great were On the BAR could reach any point in the Up except that portion

New provided direct great circle route were If employed on they could reach any point in the Map About a hour flight would be to move aircraft from Far East home bases to area bases and about three to five from Western bases to the Kola Flying times for BADGER or ISO aircraft would be about half as We have almost no recent evidence on the status and fuel storage or the availability of tank trucks at most of the forward How the are fully capable of develop ing these if they do not already have P Authority For we believe the a fuel truck of gallon capacity and a rate of per careful preparation could permit the to refer successive of the bomber force at forward which would reduce time on the ground and the number of ing trucks and personnel When ISO and BAR appear in service in large we estimate that the will have available refueling equipment more compatible with the of these In order to service large ers of bomber at staging bases in forward it would probably be necessary to

Up military SOVIET STRATEGIC AND Of A To Probable Soviet Strategic m Attack on the Up and Key Up Overseas The foregoing discussion of Soviet assumed an Soviet effort against the Up and key Up overseas install without consideration of other strategic against which some of these might be The actual initial allow of Soviet effort against various Authority in event of general war would depend upon the strategy of the In upon this the Soviet would be by the following The power of the Up is the main support of Free World opposition to the Communist The would probably calculate that if Up strength could be suffix gently reduced in the initial of a Soviet for ultimate success in a gen real war would be virtually The chief immediate threat to the in event of general war is a Up nuclear air The Soviet have demon their sensitivity to the danger of Up nuclear air attack by the high priority which they have given to the development of their till Despite the substantial progress in building up these it is unlikely they regard their offensive adequate substantial of aircraft from reaching strategic in the The major proportion of equip and which together constitute Up nuclear is in the con Soviet destruction of all key Up and overseas which possess a capability for nuclear would handicap put would not the of a very substantial ber of nuclear on within the At the same Soviet or naturalization of us nuclear capable in the continental Up would not prevent the delivery of a substantial number of nuclear from those Up overseas and which possess a nu clear strike Soviet would probably calculate that simply cutaneous destruction or naturalization of both these overseas and and those in the Up would be essential also must realize that other Up and as well as those of Up allies particularly in sent formidable to Soviet success in that would occur simultaneously with immediately after the initial In view of the above it is likely that the in the Up and key overseas and would have the following major military to destroy or neutralize us for nuclear to deliver such an attack on and biological in the Up as would or at least the mobilization of the Up war potential and its projection and to inflict such destruction on Up overseas as to hamper or Up re enforcement and logistical support of We believe that these Soviet would remain the same throughout the period of this estimate although Soviet for them will in crease of Soviet to achieve maximum Soviet at tack on the continental key overseas and location of all or most of the dis cursed in this would require prep that would almost certainly result in If the the loss of to maximize surprise it would probably be forced to accept the following major limit no mobilization of add no deployment of Soviet or to enforce peripheral and no unusual movement of Soviet or ground in such would be likely to indicate the imminent of In an attack on the Up and key Up overseas and the So estimate of the success they would be likely to achieve against various target would not necessarily be the determine next of the priority of their This priority would most likely be determined by their estimate of the necessity for or the foremost threat to their a nuclear air attack by Up The initial Soviet would complete discussion of the problem or achieve ing see IE for pub location in June Authority probably be directed primarily toward those and against those which comprise the Up nuclear strike It is not likely that they would take prior against other target and thus risk losing the advantage of surprise which they would require for successful against the primary although simultaneous against such other would probably be Probable of Attack Against the Up Nuclear by In view of the of both maximum surprise and maximum weight in any attack on the we believe that the would place chief reliance on nuclear by air It is probable that such would receive the highest priority because the limited of and for Up security inherent in the the say large of nuclear by clandestine the insufficient de development of other of delivery of nu clear on a large the client development of other mass destruction or

employment of biological or nuclear might occur against specially selected Probable of Against Key Up Overseas and The would have a much range of for effective attack on key Up and overseas than on the us itself because of the shorter greater for and ability to employ varied of at on Up naval task would present many difficult location and Western and the on the majority of key Up install in

an enlarged stockpile of nuclear naval and greater effect likeness of ground due to introduction of nuclear the choice of primary method of attack will be unlikely to change materially because Soviet

estimate the probable degree of advance warning that could be provided by in intelligence in the event of Soviet on the United and key Up and overseas through THE NATURE Of WARNING discuss the advance warning of Soviet attack may be able to it necessary to define various possible of Warning of the likelihood of probably resulting either from So or Soviet to Western but not necessarily any direct military Warning of increasing Soviet military readiness to but without define time evidence of intent to attack or of the time of of clear intent Warning of clear intent to attack at or about a particular It improbable that stage or possibly even stage would be concur lively except in the event of high level penetration of the Soviet which to day or in case of some exceptional intelligence bonus or While intelligence might be able to say that the would be fully prepared to at tack say it would find it very difficult to say whether such prepare a firm intent to were primarily in anticipation of an Up were a deception or were to prepare against any When we of degree of it is important to bear in that both time and are and that the the warning the less civic it is likely to This inverse relation between time and specificity is an in here limitation of the warning Since the Soviet attack on the Up would be tan amount to general this estimate also with the warning which the Up would be likely to receive of Soviet initiation of general It does not consider the warning likely to be given by Up or allied nor the warning which could be from a Soviet since such warning b out side the scope of the Authority The fact that is likely to be in some degree imprecise or contingent also importance to other affecting the warning Both the nature and degree of warning which can be will always be depend on many complex some of them unique to any given set of circumstance Warning will depend first of all on maximum alertness and a maximum scale of continuous effort by These would probably be only in a period of rising tension and might be even if the tension to if there were intermittent of apparently or if intelligence had previously given false The effectiveness learning also on the continued credibility of intelligence to responsible for warning as a process in complete only when it is The ess is thus by the whole context of in which it psychological and even pure It cannot be as a mechanical process which it is for intelligence to set up once and for all and which there after We believe that a Soviet initiation of general war by on the its al or key overseas would almost certainly be by height end While such ten son would in itself constitute warning that war was the of Soviet which would probably be could be in as evidence of for defense or as part of a war of Soviet behavior in a period of political tension would not necessarily give specific warning of a So intention to intelligence could probably give warning of the increasing war readiness and could probably chart the trend to ward a period of maximum It would also be possible for the Soviet after a period of ten son in which they had brought both their political and military to an advanced to bring about an amelioration of the crisis atmosphere as a deception Such a while sacrifice of some would almost certainly be made if the Soviet considered that a mum degree of surprise was essential to their strategic Allied might still able to de text the continuation of specific military which would be particularly significant as evidence of a Soviet intent to achieve surprise in gen real If the chose to initiate war with and air aft er a period of there would be numerous of as well as of economic and political necessary to prepare such We believe that Up intelligence might be able to give a generalized degree of warn ing as long as four or possibly even six prior to and that the min mum period would not be less than Authority After the number of would probably be reduced due to Soviet security although the latter would themselves provide From and especially there would probably be certain of although messing and these on a timely basis would probably be As the time of attack drew of its approach would become in increasingly Based on Soviet military warning could probably be given from a few to a days in of the actual launch ing of In order to gain some degree the might choose to initiate general war by of less than full scale in the Middle or in the Far East directly or through the while simultaneously at taking the Up and overseas install The degree of prior Soviet prep would depending on the location of the attack arid the in density and direction of the preceding Even the political mum which the would have to take to put its in a state of readiness to and to pro video support after the attack would probably require about We be live that warning of the probability of attack could be given about one week in but the period might vary from a few to as much as de pending on the seasonal pattern of So military We have in IE that by its maximum capability the could now launch about er aircraft against the Up in an initial virtually all of these aircraft would be medium bomber and a few would be heavy and The great bulk would have to fly At Soviet preparatory for maximum scale attack would require at least several and probably considerably and would probably become known to allied especially if carried forward with great We believe that the in would probably assume a mean mindful pattern in time for intelligence to give a generalized of warning to Up would also be likely the movement of the large of aircraft to staging bases involved in such a maximum scale We believe that intelligence could give specific advance warning of un usual and possibly threatening air active on the order of We have in IE if the a surprise attack against the Up in aircraft would probably be from available staging bases in the and s There is a lack of sufficient evidence to permit Here and in and warning given in as the time between the receipt of Information a Up command or agency authority to alert Up which threat of a possible imminent Soviet air and the time such an attack would reach the continental early warn ing line and line For a full discussion of these forward see IE Gross tor At on the Up and Key Overseas and through Authority a firm assessment of the of the individual bases in these for staging bomber we believe that by a major effort the could launch some aircraft on initial attack against the for such an attack would permit possible de section by allied intelligence if de would provide a generalized free of warning of several and civic advance warning of unusual and possibly threatening air activity on the order of A reduced scale of in about aircraft could be against the Up accompany need by an extraordinary might be in with little or no specific advance warning to Up This estimate on the be life the forward bases may now be capable of handling these aircraft or may become so without detectable prepare the anti equip of the Soviet Air Force by a major be advanced to a point where only minimum prepare would be prior to a mum attack which could then number about bomber Provided that such a major effort been in and out of the forward staging bases may also become The likelihood that these would be discovered would not be much less than at but the difficulty of them as warning would thus be very much More by the of jet will reduce the time for movement to staging bases and the pro able handling at the bases will reduce time refueling and Consequently the specific advance warning of unusual threatening air activity and possibly which could be assuming that movement to the staging bases was dis covered and correctly would probably be on the order of Both at present and in if the movement to staging bases was not dis warning could be only if almost

a considerable bearing on the degree of warning which might be There are three in which the might deliberately decide to attack the Up and key overseas thus tilting general These would arise if the Soviet came to that the pad acquired such military ca that it could be certain of success in a general that the Up and its allies were an attack on and the only hope of in seizing the or an shift in the relative weight of military power was impending which would ultimately force the to choose certain de feat in war and sacrifice of its vital We believe that the Soviet are unlikely to come to any of these during the period of this There remains the possibility that gen real war might occur after series of and in some local crisis which neither the nor the Western Allies finally intended to lead to general If the that the at stake were vital to its security or that the loss of prestige involved in backing down would be equally dangerous to Soviet and if it that the Up would not then the might decide that general war was the unavoidable consequence of the crisis and that it should seize the We be live that if the to launch gen real war in the period through the decision most likely to come as the cone sequence of such a Soviet toward general war to paragraph are more fully IE and Probable of Action Through May I and For a Soviet decision Likelihood of a Period of In the situation under a So decision to attack the Up would be by a period of even if the Soviet any one of the three in they would probably do so of an shift in international or because of some equally open and marked al iteration or impending of the real time weight of Such would themselves be likely to produce political There are in which a Soviet decision for war could be taken the absence of political as might be the re suit of some technical in try Unknown to the Western or a Soviet decision as under above might be the result of some secret technical advance in Western military capable of which Soviet intelligence We believe that such are unlikely to since an attack on the if it is most likely to arise a series of and not originally to lead to general war it would almost be by a period of Reliability of Political in a Period of While the existence of a prior period of tension would in itself tube warning that war was becoming more it would also greatly increase the faculty of from Soviet political be savior a specific warning of Most of the political taken by the during a period of war preparation might not differ greatly from those as time in any period of political ten These

otherwise have hoped probably to neutralize also involve the clear assumption of response ability for war by aggressive and thus might garden the will to resist in some Western the Soviet would almost

bring about an amelioration of the crisis atmosphere as a deception They could offer as a basis for new and late reduction of some of their military prep or even actually reduce If they considered surprise essential to their and that they still could achieve some degree of surprise in their till this would be a likely course for the Soviet to such a course would involve sacrifice of some ad An initial surprise assault at Western retaliatory power might include The probable degree of warning that the West would receive of Soviet attack would de end in large part upon the type of attack Many of action are open to the Soviet in the event they should decide to initiate general At one end of the spectrum would be a massive Soviet attack on the Up and allied after a period of intensive Such a

the aircraft would require to reach such together with the time re for refueling and the we believe that intelligence could give specific advance warning of unusual and possibly threatening air

allied intelligence if the relative priority as to timing and weight of attack between the us and overseas would not affect the advance warning by they would be of great significance for the tactical warning derived from radar due to the times at which aircraft bound tor at fervent would be picked For ex it the chose to make on before on the Up those would alert the continental Up defense although

Soviet recon size that the Bloc is geographically sur rounded by Up Allied air power to such an extent that from present or overseas the major portion of the Bloc can be by Up on Map and that heavy or medium can reach anywhere in the Soviet Bloc either from overseas or from They also probably estimate that a large portion of the Bloc can be by fighter light and by carrier and that Up air could penetrate the Bloc at any Warning Due the fact the Bloc is almost surrounded by Up bases and the fact that Up can operate in adjacent to Bloc the pro of adequate warning must pear extremely difficult to the Soviet This problem will become more difficult ing the period of this since the speed of Up aircraft is increasing at a more rapid rate than the increase in range of early warning radar Map although a minimum of two warning can be by the Bloc for a considerable of their land area in by they would be able to achieve a maximum of two warning of attack by aircraft even for the central area of their territory This Soviet estimate of the Up air threat is based upon information available to the In open such as and The probably that during this period the Bloc could be at backed by Western

approximately square of the total Bloc area of square Outside of these main local exist in a few chosen but large of the interior and certain border may have little or no active air Authority The Bloc large ers of air defense and of which the fighter aircraft gently appear to be the most The have made great in radar development and have large quan of both obsolescent and modern ra dar We estimate

concentration of antiaircraft and fight ers in the Soviet Far East make it one of the best of the The and the are less well than the Maritime of the Far East but do have rea notably adequate early warning Because of the operational and the limited fighter and AA avail able in these only limited could be believe the air of these will be consider early between now and but will still be below that

difficulty and we believe that the air defense to be pro video the region during the period of this estimate will remain considerably in fervor to that by the Other As far as is there are virtually no air defense available the northern and very few or radar in central We estimate that practically no air defense capable exist in this area except around local critical target along the In like the southern of the Bloc in Central also appear to be practically under We estimate that early warn ing radar will be established along these by and that all air defense will be How we do not believe the will be able to provide a strong air defense in these by due to the size of the and the many re later to and Authority DISCUSSION THE MAGNITUDE Of DEFENSE their early warning zone were extended be bond their at least nautical Soviet Estimate of the Air Threat to the The intensive buildup of and early air since World War n that the is acute aware of the threat to the by Western nuclear air The Soviet recon size that the Bloc is geographically sur rounded by Up Allied air power to such an extent that from present or overseas the major portion of the Bloc can be by Up on Map and that heavy or medium can reach anywhere in the Soviet Bloc either from overseas or from They also probably estimate that a large portion of the Bloc can be by fighter light and by carrier and that Up air could penetrate the Bloc at any Warning Due the fact the Bloc is almost surrounded by Up bases and the fact that Up can operate in adjacent to Bloc the pro of adequate warning must pear extremely difficult to the Soviet This problem will become more difficult ing the period of this since the speed of Up aircraft is increasing at a more rapid rate than the increase in range of early warning radar Map although a minimum of two warning can be by the Bloc for a considerable of their land area in by they would be able to achieve a maximum of two warning of attack by aircraft even for the central area of their territory This Soviet estimate of the Up air threat is based upon information available to the In open such as and The probably that during this period the Bloc could be at backed by Western jet and piston aircraft with radii of action up to nautical up to operational up to Based upon their own experience and upon knowledge of Up organizational production budgetary and aircraft dev the could probably make a fairly accurate estimate of the of us aircraft which would be available for against the We believe that this estimate night as Aircraft Piston Heavy Jet Medium Piston Medium Jet Light Jet Jet Fighter Navy Patrol TAL a few Appendix A for Soviet estimate of performance of aircraft and and of for operational The probably could not estimate with any accuracy the of which could be employed against them during the period of this they could probably arrive at a fairly good estimate of missile availability in of total production in some order of On this they probably estimate that Up and Allied stockpile would include by a few long range and several thousand of the smaller They would probably estimate that the following general of might be available for use against Carl Q P F C F Range head Speed Weight Of Of They also probably estimate that some of these could be from naval and that several and will be for such launch Aircraft Armament and The probably estimate that Up will ma with automatic fire radar detection and jam mining a national system to operate over all of terrain and under all weather and defensive radar for detection and fire and The pro able estimate that all strike could carry either nuclear or conventional delivery to some extent by the of a specific air craft would fix the of the of nuclear which could be Dive or could be employed for the for and high altitude horizontal for Scale and Direction of The probably estimate that the Up great flexibility in and direct probably estimate that the scale and direction of might simultaneous from all by several hundred sustained over a period of several from one direction and widely sustained by individual air craft from all and at all up to They probably would an anticipate against the Bloc by medium from bases in the North the and aircraft could be from bases in some of these and from bases in other forward such as South and West Map could also be made by heavy and medium from bases in the Up and and from such forward base as and the The might expect air from carrier task operating in the the the and in the western They probably calculate that carrier task could operate from their coast these which would allow penetration by carrier aircraft to up to nautical The probably expect to be against Bloc could be from overseas bases and naval short range from forward Up overseas surface and and from bases in the continental Up and Probable Air Defense to Meet Threat The for an effective Bloc air defense system have been considered in the light the probable Soviet appraisal of Western for the evidence of the type of air defense system already by the Up air defense experience and con and the of such Bloc air defense equipment as and AA Many of the inherent in of an air defense system have not been value aged in at these How we believe the air defense Authority stated herein constitute the most probable of Soviet air defense through the period of this Any great increase over the stated might be considered too costly and any large decrease would probably be considered too risky by Soviet Although is possible that the might plan an air defense system entirely different from the one in these present Soviet defense indicate that the favoring this would be During the period of this mate we believe the Soviet Bloc will have a requirement for an early warning system which will detection of all of craft and at alt In of the pro up to able of aircraft and a desire able warning time of the at which early warning is from Bloc will vary from nautical for present aircraft to nautical for aircraft and by To meet these the would have extend their early warning install to beyond their present in certain by the use of early warning air craft and picket and generally ex tend their present by use of proved radar equipment and a greater number A theoretical minimum of some early warning radar would be to provide two around the and Command Re In order to provide a picture of the air situation in the responsible control and to provide continuous de tailed on specific radar coverage would be in depth to the major target In an auto data and control system would be to meet the for more rapid evaluation and transmission of This requirement would necessitate at least radar in the Soviet together with greatly community a total of some of or other secure and an automatic handling To permit command reaction at all a highly trained air defense prompt general direction of all passive and active air defense would be the critical nature of the time in air defense that many of the operational heretofore made by major must be to lower command This would be highly dependent upon response ability and initiative and would necessitate high level of individual and unit training for all air defense The will have a requirement for system which will provide identification of friendly under all a would some for equipment In view of present Engagement and in Soviet air the al most certainly estimate that they could not rely upon one system and that several would be for an acceptable capability for interception and kill under night and all weather To meet these they will have to greatly improve the performance of their inter center will almost certainly be for use against enemy supersonic aircraft and Defense against low altitude at will require and un in large in addition to proved automatic The would probably estimate the following as Bloc opera for air defense of the Bloc during the period of this A Day Right AA Heavy Antiaircraft SAM or low to Air There are now about in the Bloc suitable for fighter the probably consider many of these unsuitable to meet air defense through the period of this They probably estimate that many have to be and that new have to be in peripheral and in highly important defense They might require a total of some by of which about would be for air defense and for other operational PRESENT Soviet appreciation of the

This estimate does not concern itself with the strategy or tactics that might be by Up air in an attack the nor it attempt to evaluate the kill pro Blue air defense against aircraft or It should also

Section n the present strength and of the air defense and Section m the future of Bloc Air Defense in economic of the Blue to support it air defense The estimate in Section m is based on the as assumption that neither domestic or inter national political nor unexpected technological will alter the general nature of as now in the Bloc and the West Air defense of the Bloc been on a high De to date have revealed two ma for of air defense The most important is a huge area em bracing all of Russia and the In this area is con about percent of the Bloc establishment with associated an aircraft artillery and The se cond major area is the Soviet Far in which is concentrated about cent of Bloc fighter Thus about percent of Bloc air defense for es are concentrated in critical bring only approximately square of the total Bloc area of square Outside of these main local exist in a few chosen but large of the interior and certain border may have little or no active air Authority The Bloc large ers of air defense and of which the fighter aircraft gently appear to be the most The have made great in radar development and have large quan of both obsolescent and modern ra dar We estimate there are a total of about men actively en aged in air defense in the Bloc and that the Bloc an authorized fighter strength of some about About are assigned to Fighter of Air assigned to other also have some air defense under a Map The an air defense organization under the control of the A few have extensive underground we believe the passive defense system does greatly affect air Present

assumption that neither domestic and inter national political nor unexpected tech biological will alter the general nature of aa now in the Bloc and the See also COP note Despite these mate that Bloc air would fall considerably short of providing air de of the scale and nature by the probable Western air The Bloc air defense pro gram through would constitute a substantial but not impossible burden on the Bloc the cost would be such as to require either a di version of resource from other military or an increase in total military bud get such as would probably lead to some in the rate of growth

air we have assumed that air de are it is that air defense and install do exist in these Air defense of the East Ger solar as it upon Sa satellite is to be generally inferior to that of critical within the The Satellite air defense are generally poorly trained and with obsolescent aircraft and equipment and they would be incapable of meeting air or of transit of Western bomber route to the Under day light at between Tap SECRETe Authority and they could inflict consider enable damage on bomber for by These would be to the extent that Soviet air defense were de to these Soviet Far The concentration of antiaircraft and fight ers in the Soviet Far East make it one of the best of the The and the are less well than the Maritime of the Far East but do have rea notably adequate early warning Because of the operational and the limited fighter and AA avail able in these only limited could be believe the air of these will be consider early between now and but will still be below that of the Maritime Kola and These are considered to be relatively well in and Radar coverage from Kola to approximately East but the density of radar in the eastern part of this area is probably not as great as in other critical approach We believe it will be considerably during the period of this and Western Black These are the most heavily of the The ma for of Fighter Aviation of Air De large of AA in possible missile all of the of the Basic and Black Sea and the bulk of the Soviet tactical air are in this It is that continuous of hostile aircraft can be accomplished throughout this area since the concern ration of radar greater than our assessment of actual China North North Substantial air defense capable exist in North and North Along the extreme south coastal the capable are less and in the interior are virtually Early warning are being extended southward along the Air are really being in the The size of the region the development of an network a task of Consequently difficulty and we believe that the air defense to be pro video the region during the period of this estimate will remain considerably in fervor to that by the Other As far as is there are virtually no air defense available the northern and very few or radar in central We estimate that practically no air defense capable exist in this area except around local critical target along the In like the southern of the Bloc in Central also appear to be practically under We estimate that early warn ing radar will be established along these by and that all air defense will be How we do not believe the will be able to provide a strong air defense in these by due to the size of the and the many re later to and Authority DISCUSSION THE MAGNITUDE Of DEFENSE their early warning zone were extended be bond their at least nautical Soviet Estimate of the Air Threat to the The intensive buildup of and early air since World War n that the is acute aware of the threat to the by Western nuclear air The Soviet recon size that the Bloc is geographically sur rounded by Up Allied air power to such an extent that from present or overseas the major portion of the Bloc can be by Up on Map and that heavy or medium can reach anywhere in the Soviet Bloc either from overseas or from They also probably estimate that a large portion of the Bloc can be by fighter light and by carrier and that Up air could penetrate the Bloc at any Warning Due the fact the Bloc is almost surrounded by Up bases and the fact that Up can operate in adjacent to Bloc the pro of adequate warning must pear extremely difficult to the Soviet This problem will become more difficult ing the period of this since the speed of Up aircraft is increasing at a more rapid rate than the increase in range of early warning radar Map although a minimum of two warning can be by the Bloc for a considerable of their land area in by they would be able to achieve a maximum of two warning of attack by aircraft even for the central area of their territory This Soviet estimate of the Up air threat is based upon information available to the In open such as and The probably that during this period the Bloc could be at backed by Western jet and piston aircraft with radii of action up to nautical up to operational up to Based upon their own experience and upon knowledge of Up organizational production budgetary and aircraft dev the could probably make a fairly accurate estimate of the of us aircraft which would be available for against the We believe that this estimate night as Aircraft Piston Heavy Jet Medium Piston Medium Jet Light Jet Jet Fighter Navy Patrol TAL a few Appendix A for Soviet estimate of performance of aircraft and and of for operational The probably could not estimate with any accuracy the of which could be employed against them during the period of this they could probably arrive at a fairly good estimate of missile availability in of total production in some order of On this they probably estimate that Up and Allied stockpile would include by a few long range and several thousand of the smaller They would probably estimate that the following general of might be available for use against Carl Q P F C F Range head Speed Weight Of Of They also probably estimate that some of these could be from naval and that several and will be for such launch Aircraft Armament and The probably estimate that Up will ma with automatic fire radar detection and jam mining a national system to operate over all of terrain and under all weather and defensive radar for detection and fire and The pro able estimate that all strike could carry either nuclear or conventional delivery to some extent by the of a specific air craft would fix the of the of nuclear which could be Dive or could be employed for the for and high altitude horizontal for Scale and Direction of The probably estimate that the Up great flexibility in and direct probably estimate that the scale and direction of might simultaneous from all by several hundred sustained over a period of several from one direction and widely sustained by individual air craft from all and at all up to They probably would an anticipate against the Bloc by medium from bases in the North the and aircraft could be from bases in some of these and from bases in other forward such as South and West Map could also be made by heavy and medium from bases in the Up and and from such forward base as and the The might expect air from carrier task operating in the the the and in the western They probably calculate that carrier task could operate from their coast these which would allow penetration by carrier aircraft to up to nautical The probably expect to be against Bloc could be from overseas bases and naval short range from forward Up overseas surface and and from bases in the continental Up and Probable Air Defense to Meet Threat The for an effective Bloc air defense system have been considered in the light the probable Soviet appraisal of Western for the evidence of the type of air defense system already by the Up air defense experience and con and the of such Bloc air defense equipment as and AA Many of the inherent in of an air defense system have not been value aged in at these How we believe the air defense Authority stated herein constitute the most probable of Soviet air defense through the period of this Any great increase over the stated might be considered too costly and any large decrease would probably be considered too risky by Soviet Although is possible that the might plan an air defense system entirely different from the one in these present Soviet defense indicate that the favoring this would be During the period of this mate we believe the Soviet Bloc will have a requirement for an early warning system which will detection of all of craft and at alt In of the pro up to able of aircraft and a desire able warning time of the at which early warning is from Bloc will vary from nautical for present aircraft to nautical for aircraft and by To meet these the would have extend their early warning install to beyond their present in certain by the use of early warning air craft and picket and generally ex tend their present by use of proved radar equipment and a greater number A theoretical minimum of some early warning radar would be to provide two around the and Command Re In order to provide a picture of the air situation in the responsible control and to provide continuous de tailed on specific radar coverage would be in depth to the major target In an auto data and control system would be to meet the for more rapid evaluation and transmission of This requirement would necessitate at least radar in the Soviet together with greatly community a total of some of or other secure and an automatic handling To permit command reaction at all a highly trained air defense prompt general direction of all passive and active air defense would be the critical nature of the time in air defense that many of the operational heretofore made by major must be to lower command This would be highly dependent upon response ability and initiative and would necessitate high level of individual and unit training for all air defense The will have a requirement for system which will provide identification of friendly under all a would some for equipment In view of present Engagement and in Soviet air the al most certainly estimate that they could not rely upon one system and that several would be for an acceptable capability for interception and kill under night and all weather To meet these they will have to greatly improve the performance of their inter center will almost certainly be for use against enemy supersonic aircraft and Defense against low altitude at will require and un in large in addition to proved automatic The would probably estimate the following as Bloc opera for air defense of the Bloc during the period of this A Day Right AA Heavy Antiaircraft SAM or low to Air There are now about in the Bloc suitable for fighter the probably consider many of these unsuitable to meet air defense through the period of this They probably estimate that many have to be and that new have to be in peripheral and in highly important defense They might require a total of some by of which about would be for air defense and for other operational PRESENT Soviet appreciation of the growing West em air and nuclear is reflected in the intensive postwar buildup of Soviet air and the high priority and great to Postwar Soviet air defense doctrine was greatly ended by the of Western

bond their at least nautical Soviet Estimate of the Air Threat to the The intensive buildup of and early air since World War n that the is acute aware of the threat to the by Western nuclear air The Soviet recon size that the Bloc is geographically sur rounded by Up Allied air power to such an extent that from present or overseas the major portion of the Bloc can be by Up on Map and that heavy or medium can reach anywhere in the Soviet Bloc either from overseas or from They also probably estimate that a large portion of the Bloc can be by fighter light and by carrier and that Up air could penetrate the Bloc at any Warning Due the fact the Bloc is almost surrounded by Up bases and the fact that Up can operate in adjacent to Bloc the pro of adequate warning must pear extremely difficult to the Soviet This problem will become more difficult ing the period of this since the speed of Up aircraft is increasing at a more rapid rate than the increase in range of early warning radar Map although a minimum of two warning can be by the Bloc for a considerable of their land area in by they would be able to achieve a maximum of two warning of attack by aircraft even for the central area of their territory This Soviet estimate of the Up air threat is based upon information available to the In open such as and The probably that during this period the Bloc could be at backed by Western jet and piston aircraft with radii of action up to nautical up to operational up to Based upon their own experience and upon knowledge of Up organizational production budgetary and aircraft dev the could probably make a fairly accurate estimate of the of us aircraft which would be available for against the We believe that this estimate night as Aircraft Piston Heavy Jet Medium Piston Medium Jet Light Jet Jet Fighter Navy Patrol TAL a few Appendix A for Soviet estimate of performance of aircraft and and of for operational The probably could not estimate with any accuracy the of which could be employed against them during the period of this they could probably arrive at a fairly good estimate of missile availability in of total production in some order of On this they probably estimate that Up and Allied stockpile would include by a few long range and several thousand of the smaller They would probably estimate that the following general of might be available for use against Carl Q P F C F Range head Speed Weight Of Of They also probably estimate that some of these could be from naval and that several and will be for such launch Aircraft Armament and The probably estimate that Up will ma with automatic fire radar detection and jam mining a national system to operate over all of terrain and under all weather and defensive radar for detection and fire and The pro able estimate that all strike could carry either nuclear or conventional delivery to some extent by the of a specific air craft would fix the of the of nuclear which could be Dive or could be employed for the for and high altitude horizontal for Scale and Direction of The probably estimate that the Up great flexibility in and direct probably estimate that the scale and direction of might simultaneous from all by several hundred sustained over a period of several from one direction and widely sustained by individual air craft from all and at all up to They probably would an anticipate against the Bloc by medium from bases in the North the and aircraft could be from bases in some of these and from bases in other forward such as South and West Map could also be made by heavy and medium from bases in the Up and and from such forward base as and the The might expect air from carrier task operating in the the the and in the western They probably calculate that carrier task could operate from their coast these which would allow penetration by carrier aircraft to up to nautical The probably expect to be against Bloc could be from overseas bases and naval short range from forward Up overseas surface and and from bases in the continental Up and Probable Air Defense to Meet Threat The for an effective Bloc air defense system have been considered in the light the probable Soviet appraisal of Western for the evidence of the type of air defense system already by the Up air defense experience and con and the of such Bloc air defense equipment as and AA Many of the inherent in of an air defense system have not been value aged in at these How we believe the air defense Authority stated herein constitute the most probable of Soviet air defense through the period of this Any great increase over the stated might be considered too costly and any large decrease would probably be considered too risky by Soviet Although is possible that the might plan an air defense system entirely different from the one in these present Soviet defense indicate that the favoring this would be During the period of this mate we believe the Soviet Bloc will have a requirement for an early warning system which will detection of all of craft and at alt In of the pro up to able of aircraft and a desire able warning time of the at which early warning is from Bloc will vary from nautical for present aircraft to nautical for aircraft and by To meet these the would have extend their early warning install to beyond their present in certain by the use of early warning air craft and picket and generally ex tend their present by use of proved radar equipment and a greater number A theoretical minimum of some early warning radar would be to provide two around the and Command Re In order to provide a picture of the air situation in the responsible control and to provide continuous de tailed on specific radar coverage would be in depth to the major target In an auto data and control system would be to meet the for more rapid evaluation and transmission of This requirement would necessitate at least radar in the Soviet together with greatly community a total of some of or other secure and an automatic handling To permit command reaction at all a highly trained air defense prompt general direction of all passive and active air defense would be the critical nature of the time in air defense that many of the operational heretofore made by major must be to lower command This would be highly dependent upon response ability and initiative and would necessitate high level of individual and unit training for all air defense The will have a requirement for system which will provide identification of friendly under all a would some for equipment In view of present Engagement and in Soviet air the al most certainly estimate that they could not rely upon one system and that several would be for an acceptable capability for interception and kill under night and all weather To meet these they will have to greatly improve the performance of their inter center will almost certainly be for use against enemy supersonic aircraft and Defense against low altitude at will require and un in large in addition to proved automatic The would probably estimate the following as Bloc opera for air defense of the Bloc during the period of this A Day Right AA Heavy Antiaircraft SAM or low to Air There are now about in the Bloc suitable for fighter the probably consider many of these unsuitable to meet air defense through the period of this They probably estimate that many have to be and that new have to be in peripheral and in highly important defense They might require a total of some by of which about would be for air defense and for other operational PRESENT Soviet appreciation of the

finally a move to include a West in almost certainly gave the Soviet serious concern and accelerated the change in Soviet In add we believe that a growing realization of the of nuclear conflict con

death of the Soviet have been increasingly active in seeking a gradual reduction in the of the cold The latest phase was in early with the sudden change of policy with respect to an peace After favorable reaction in March to the idea of a Four Power meeting of of the made a series of con They included an appear willingness to accept some important as of the Western position on a marked decline in the use of hostile and in domestic and for sign and a more normal handling of diplomatic In the to improve its position with respect to individual as in the of with By the time of the Summit even the special abuse reserved in Soviet propaganda for Up and policy had virtually Despite the atmosphere of amicability which the the on substantive which it put forward at the Summit meeting revealed no significant pasture from those previously On the major Issue of the pretense that the desired German unity at an early date was frankly In the discussion of made clear Soviet insistence that security l l I i Authority to be satisfactory to the must eventually bring about the of and the withdrawal of Up power from On the in effect stood firm on its proposal of The Soviet made it clear while they desired a more normal relationship with the Western they wished to achieve this on the basis of recognition of the status quo in and without of out standing which would require major So They bluntly any discussion of the status of the or of international They did imply that a major improvement in the international atmosphere could lead eventual ly to of presently insoluble con and in particular they to regard the issue of disarmament as offering some prospect for The argument which the Soviet delegation advanced at the Summit meeting was that a solution of substantive might be found in due course provided that between East and West was first The phrase to be the principal slogan of the new Soviet and was at the Summit meeting not only as a to an but as an end de sizable in As in Soviet state the significance of the Summit meeting not upon any advance which it registered toward substantive but upon the degree to which it brought about this atmosphere of In the Soviet to wish to nitrate that a regularization of on the basis of the status quo in might be mutually In the the sought energetically to sustain what it as the of that an there of mutual confidence between the con tending power Soviet al though more critical of the Up than during the Summit continued to re fleet a tone of calculated It handled old with new and with relative illness to

strength and their belief in the ultimate victory of Communist In the recent with the German Federal Republic and with East the its position that German unity will depend in the first instance upon a between the two of and thus that it a divided Ger many for some to In the Near the since a more active notably by offering military assistance to certain In the Far the since have re axed their pressure in the but they have continued to build up their mile try and have not their on basic The announcement of to reduce the Soviet and Satellite armed and the decision to return the naval base to while not materially the general military have provided the with a basis for that the West should take similar CURRENT SOVIET POLICY The impression left by the recent Soviet posture is that while the basic position on major remains the con duct of its foreign a notable The Soviet probably recognize that the impact on the Western world is determined not only by the substance of the Soviet position but by the Authority manner of Soviet conduct as A number of have worked together to produce the change in the Soviet The mere fact of the appearance of a new leadership in the following the death of is one important While it is possible that some similar would have come about even if had not nevertheless there is much about the style of present Soviet which probably would not been possible under pass Soviet policy from the inhibit by his The new have even largely by in direction and their realization that conduct of Soviet policy was counter productive in that it had isolated the Western determination to resist further Communist and thus con the Western Much of their current behavior is clearly intended to undo these In the na true of the new leadership to have brought about a more relaxed behavior among the top and may have led to a more realistic appraisal of the internal and external The change in Soviet conduct was almost certainly accelerated by the ratification of the This event was a serious set back for Soviet which for had as one of its major the prevention of West German armament under While the menace of a West may not have very the prospect of a substantial further increase in together with un certainty as to the effect which German in fluency might eventually have on toward the almost certainly given the Soviet serious Once the were it probably imperative to the Soviet that a new course be The final stage in the decision to in corporate a West in with a growing crisis in the We are unable to estimate what effect this situation or other unsolved in had on the Soviet view of their They may have genuinely feared an outbreak of between the Up and Communist China which would have carried serious risk of Soviet They may have perhaps in concert with the Chi that Communist in would be more effectively by a phase of maneuver based on a In any whatever the precise are to believe that the situation in a part in the which led the to adopt its present Soviet concern over West German rear and over in was probably by a growing realization that any serious risk of given the probability that Up would make large scale use of nuclear had become Probably the progress in nuclear in recent together with a greater heed possibly given to professional military in policy since to this In any we believe that concern over the danger of nu clear war been one important factor in the current desire to reduce The is probably par concerned over its presently inferior nuclear the Up and there fore to minimize of general We believe that one of the important motive for current Soviet policy may be the de sire to gain time to narrow the gap in nuclear warfare Economic have almost mainly been another factor in the Soviet policy While we believe that Soviet re are adequate to continue building up the military the effort upon the a series of difficult in the allocation of Besides continue ing its traditional emphasis on heavy index the is currently engaged in a vast effort to increase agricultural production by expanding cultivated a program which a In add the rate of increase in the size of the in industrial labor on which Soviet industrial growth been largely is Authority This together with of increase in labor will require heavy in further and replacement of machinery if Soviet industrial output is to continue to grow at high The desire to to the West in basic industrial power certainly con times to be a leading Soviet The is also under some political compulsion to assist in the industrialization of Communist At the same the enormous cost of the which the Soviet lead ers will wish to acquire over the next few air in strategic air in modernization of ground and naval for nuclear warfare probably press hard on the economic it likely that the Soviet would welcome the opportunity to stretch out their military and thus to make additional available for comic We that the Soviet to ease international ten were in part by the desire to reduce the burden on their economic re All the and above would be if the West could be per shaded to in a of We believe that the Soviet estimate while the Western alliance grew in strength and unity so as Soviet policy continued an aggressive and hostile it might prove vulnerable if the in a convincing demonstration of peaceful The to have that a less provocative posture on its part might be by the appear of in the West and by a decline in Western defense If such are the Soviet will expect even tally to achieve a much greater latitude of diplomatic maneuver which might enable them to undermine the effectiveness of and other free world and thus move toward one of their principal the political and military isolation of the They may also calculate as the convict in the free world that the Comma list do not present a serious the Communist will be able to break out of the isolation into which they have been particularly in Western and will become more effective of So The present Soviet line probably therefore not only from a desire to ease certain with which the is but also from the expectation that the new tactics can bring positive ad toward Soviet Soviet in the Current Phase We conclude that the Soviet have not abandoned their ing the current they have em marked on a policy at a general easing of cold war and apparently pointed toward these main To reduce the threat of nuclear conflict from continued particularly during the period of their nuclear To give time for the to continue its military and to deal with its economic and open new for dividing the Western undermining Western and extending Communist genera of the free The nature of the above that the Soviet have adopted the new policy as more than a short term tactical Soviet policy in the shown itself capable of sudden Such a reversal could again occur if the present policy to achieve its ex or if it led to prejudicial to Soviet it is always possible that a shift within the leader ship could bring to authority or favoring a different international On the we are to believe that it is the present intention of the Soviet to continue their current policy for some The care which they have taken to publicize this policy within the and thus to en courage among the people the expectation of a period of relaxed international sup that they intend to persist in their While we believe that the could reverse a policy of relaxation at any Authority it is possible that if such a policy con tinged for a long the present Soviet leadership would have to take into account the domestic which might follow a sudden The Soviet may regard the present phase as only an interim one to be used to close the gap between their nuclear capable and those of the They may think once they have a rough parity in nuclear they can revert to a more aggressive confident that in any crisis they could outbluff the even if the does catch up in nuclear the Soviet could still not be confident that in a general war the itself would escape nuclear They may be coming to feel that war in an age of nuclear devastation wholly accept able and that therefore they must con to pursue their ultimate by which so far as possible exclude danger of major the Soviet may hope to achieve a disarmament settlement which would effectively eliminate nuclear war after which they could again pursue an expansionism policy without recurring nuclear PROBABLE SOVIET TACTICS In FORTHCOMING Although we believe that the will continue its diplomatic and propaganda to preserve what it the of the Soviet have their determination to maintain their in forthcoming Four Power They probably hope to obtain a general de tenth on the basis of a Western acceptance of the status quo in which would legit size all the Communist in that in East and their with the rest of the world The is probably confident that the Western will not be able or prepared to bring such pressure on the Bloc as would force acceptance of Western In deed they may hope that the process of ne rotation itself will open fissure of opinion within and among the Western It will be evident from the foregoing that the task which the Soviet have set for themselves at the Four Power will be convey an impression of flexibility on the is under discussion without making signify cant from their present That they have the in is apparent from the strenuous they made at the Summit Conference to con drive a formula for the agenda which would permit them the amount of leeway in the into in which the appearance of might be without actual They some success in subordination the German question to that of security in the wording of the and undoubtedly hope by this device to mask the rigidity of their position on The complex topic of disarmament and the topic of East West will almost certainly provide the Soviet to display the am inability of their without them to make significant at least at the They will probably seek to avoid showdown and to de by provisional The Soviet have already that they will not negotiate a German settle mention acceptable to the They of that the brunt of Western diplomatic pressure will be on this and that the atmosphere of cordial which they so carefully at the Summit meeting could be by their obstinacy on this Even at this the Soviet will almost mainly refuse to compromise their The made clear that it will not kept the reunification of unless the internal political situation is so as to insure that a unified would not become either an open or secret partner of the Western The Soviet pro able believe that West German armament will not pose a security threat to the Bloc for some at In the they hope to discourage support for West German armament in Western and in West Believing that there will be Authority little enthusiasm in the West for an attempt to solve the German problem by military they probably expect to be able to main tain the status quo in They will therefore hold to the line that the German situation cannot be settled until con of have been stab listed through a security Under whatever form this latter project may be its purpose would be to undermine and bring about its security is a topic with many ramp impending upon all of the other under It is almost certain that the Soviet will try to make this the central topic of negotiation because its intricate and time range could provide endless for unavoidable and The may offer to accept the suggestion for a security treaty among a few but would not accept a unified in such a and would insist on the admission of the two The would hope that some such limited security arrangement would at least commit the West to recognition of the status quo in It would hope that mutual of security between the two block would tend gradually to sap support in the West for a sustained defense effort by The may also propose regional for example in the Basic area or in the which would include some Satellite the return of and Soviet on bases may passage a firm proposal for reducing Soviet and and bases in possibly by a unilateral with draw of some Soviet from the Disarmament is another topic upon which the Soviet have laid stress and for which they have prepared a plausible and ostensibly negotiable Like mean it is a topic of such scope and complexity that on it can be for long The will insist that inspection and control be made contain gent upon a prior agreement on reduction of and prohibition of nuclear Its in the will probably be to commit the West to fixed of armament and to limit Western freedom of action to em ploy nuclear without itself agreeing to unrestricted To achieve these the Soviet will probably be will ing to agree to similar on their own use of nuclear and actually to undertake some in the size of their own The process of even a limited disarmament agreement certain to be and during its course the will hope by its general be savior to divide Western opinion on the issue and to encourage a relaxation of military fort in the the may agree to tentative and exploratory to test the effectiveness of inspection in limited This would probably not involve any vital So security loss and would enable the to keep the issue alive while at the same time it to demonstrate adhere once to an All four agreed at the Summit Conference to take to eliminate which interfere with the flow of and trade among The may be to place stress upon this sub jet not only because of its less controversial but because it is one which can easily be to present the face of Soviet which the evidently now the world to Quite aside from this in the where it will be used to support the we expect the to continue and expand the program of social and cultural and trade promotion which it in recent This can be done on a unilateral basis and without risk since all such will on the Soviet side con to be of an official nature and close In the will ly attack Western as to the free flow of international The Soviet lead ers probably count heavily on rural and economic to have a per survive impact on Western opinion in support J Authority of their general policy line during the coming SOVIET POLICY BEYOND

CONFERENCE THE PROBLEM To assess current Soviet foreign policy in the light of the Geneva Foreign Minus Conference and recent Soviet in other particularly in the Middle THE ESTIMATE The stalemate at the Geneva Foreign Min taken together with recent Soviet in the Middle East and South been widely in the Free World as evidence of a hardening of Soviet Soviet policy been seen as turning its back upon the of peace by the Summit meet ing and itself again upon the path of cold We shall examine in this paper whether such a shift in Soviet in fact taken and the motive for recent Soviet THE DEFINITION Of THE Of In whether Soviet policy between the first and second Geneva it is important to be clear on what significance the Soviet did and did not attach to the Summit meeting and the series of which We have previously and still that the Soviet leadership actually the in international which it as the object of its By a in international the Soviet meant the establishment of a tacit understanding that in dispute be teen the Bloc and the West would not be to lead to a general crisis serious danger of general The Soviet almost certainly did not expect that a reduction in and the of which was its manifesto would bring about an early settlement of major between the Bloc and the Our previous estimate made it clear that no by the on such vital as and disarmament would be forth and that the main aim of Soviet policy in the would be to insure acquiescence in the trial status quo in Eastern At the same the Soviet gave no assure at the Summit meeting that they would abandon the pursuit of their own whether in or On the con they made it entirely clear that they would permit no discussion of International Communism or of the status of the and that the would persist in its effort to obtain of power and believe that the for this attitude dis cursed in IE were correct and that they are still See especially of IE Foreign Policy in the Light of the Summit Authority The intransigent stand which took at the Foreign meeting did not represent any departure in substance from which were implicit at the Summit The of Government did not explore these to the point where they were fully when this done at the second Geneva meeting the basic were revealed to be unchanged from what they have been for some The fact that the stubborn personality of was associated with the presentation of the Soviet stand perhaps the In how impression of the of Soviet policy were idea on the two and the widespread impression that Soviet policy had was due in the main to unwarranted popular of a shortening trend which did not The more active Soviet policy which was in the Near and Middle East and South in recent in particular in connection with the sale of arms to and the attitude and of the Soviet during their current trip in South also been seen as a retreat from the of the Summit nothing that was said by the at the Summit meeting gave any promise that the Soviet would abandon their effort to combat Western influence in touching Soviet and in fact there is hard dance that such as the deal were prior to the Summit meet Previous have stated that the would step up its activity in the Middle East in response to Western to organize defense in that From the Soviet paint of the progress made by the Northern Tier concept since the spring of been a stimulus to Soviet The par titular form this intervention taken was not in previous We still believe that the does not intend to push that intervention to the point of provoking a major crisis with the Western but its have already gone far toward pro voting a major crisis within the and have strained between the major Western and certain Middle Eastern SOVIET TACTICS A GENEVA Our previous estimate more flexibility in Soviet tactics at the Foreign meeting than was actually The effect of such flexibility would have been to avoid quite so heavy a setback to the of and to have blurred the impression of which the So did in fact Except for some effort by to avoid the more bitter which marked previous Big Four and some attempt at the end to save the conference from the appearance of complete the did little to foster a Western belief in the desire to end the cold We believe that the Soviet had some positive for wishing to make a demon station of fitness at the recent They apparently feel although they do have some internal these are man gable and present no compulsion for promising their stand on in dispute with the On the the Soviet probably regard the future course of the world struggle with They came away from the Summit meeting re assured that the West does not intend to em ploy its power to force Soviet and they believe that in the absence of a military showdown the general development of the world situation will be favorable to Given this confident state of they patently wished to make it entirely especially in view of the wide speculation in the West about their internal that there can be no progress toward settlement of outstanding if it them to make any significant They probably also felt under some necessity to make clear to the Satellite especially to East that the of these would not be for the sake of an agreement with the Authority With respect to the first item on the For sign the question of mean security and a stalemate at this conference probably was seen by the So as One of their principal current is to demonstrate to the West that there can be no hope for fulfillment of for reunion cation by way of Four Power The Soviet probably calculated that failure of this conference would be a long step toward convincing the West and the East as that the Western of will not be effective in training Soviet agreement to This they probably hope will have the effect of impending West German and of the West to enter into separate with East and the which might lead to abandonment of their with the for reunification on which would be favorable to a Communist On the disarmament it was made even clearer that the is unwilling to accept any comprehensive inspection system satisfactory to the and is particularly opposed to the proposal for aerial The Soviet counter continue to rest on for a ban on nu clear and for reduction to agreed force the Soviet position on disarmament may not have been fully revealed at For the possibility of disarmament and inspection on a restricted area as in the was not fully at the It is still possible that the would find such a scheme especially as it if applied in win a tacit Western acceptance for the division of the Aside from Geneva that the Soviet position had to remain fixed because the Soviet are unwilling to contemplate the kind of comprehensive in section upon which the West On freedom of the was interested in breaking down Western strategic trade while the West ted a comprehensive program for greater freedom of Some Western pro the was certain to and did since acceptance would have involved toward ending the isolation of the Soviet and Satellite which the regime clearly re as On other the agreement in principle or sup tested bilateral but no agree were actually the itself prepared to con and even expand the kind of program of by which serve a propaganda purpose and acquire use In while Soviet policy cannot accept Western of freedom in between it probably does not intend to return to the of post World War In Of GENEVA OR FUTURE SOVIET POLICY It is evident that the Soviet have no intention in the foreseeable future of ing toward a settlement of the major between them and the They recognize that they could do so only by making import want This they not only feel under no compulsion to but in the case of almost certainly believe that to make would be dangerous to their Satellite The confidence which the Soviet show in taking this position may be based in part on the impression of Western the Summit Their confidence must have been by their recent progress in the development of nuclear they received at Unless there should be a major deteriorate of the international the is unlikely for some time to press semi only toward resumption of Four Power neo There have been many how that it to direct toward bilateral with Up allies and in the Middle East and The object of such would be to work toward the of Free World and the isolation of the Up Authority The Soviet may even believe that eventually the Up itself will be willing to negotiate The Soviet probably recognize that to pursue such successfully it will be necessary for the Bloc to refrain from major military they will pro able continue their to demonstrate that the are peaceful while at the same time that it is the West which are from the of While there will remain various of critical friction in the and and per we believe on balance that the does not intend to allow a general crisis of major to grow out of these It is apparently the Soviet intention to give heavy attention to the Middle East and South The sale of arms and the ex tensile of technical and economic aid which have been made there are new dear turns for Soviet and demonstrate the flexibility of its current The Bloc certain in with the West for influence in these It can play upon the endemic suspicion of the former colonial and the widespread admiral for the rapid pace of Soviet economic It is in a better position than the West to absorb certain important raw of some of these and presumably ample stocks of descent arms to provide one of pay It is now offering on easier than the West Whether or not the Bloc can develop such a program on a significant scale will depend upon the availability of within the for which the economic development of the especially of Communist and the military will be compete The competitive challenge by the West will also be a It is too early to judge how far such a program may be or even if the present will be We think it that the is engaged merely in a cam pain of propaganda and more pro able that the Soviet are determined entering upon a campaign of CONCLUSION Previous have and recent the Foreign Conference that the of the regime remain the same as those of its to increase the power and improve the security of the Communist to prevent the of the Free power against the and to expand the Communist The present regime designed to achieve these by which are less obviously aggressive than It thereby to improve its reputation for peaceful the Soviet believe that by persistent and vigorous prop economic and especially in where the Free World is they can gradually alter

for the next few Intermediate Ballistic size In the could have ready for series production a dual stage ballistic missile of about range with a of three to four Large yield nuclear would probably be available in the were willing to accept a re used range of this missile could be made ready for series production as early as but in this case only a low yield nuclear would be avail Intercontinental Ballistic Missile We now estimate that as soon Probable percent within the stated All and are given in nautical as the could have ready for series production an intercontinental ballistic missile of with a large yield nuclear and a of roughly five of an would create an entirely new type of threat to the Earth We estimate that the are to develop such a vehicle at the practicable date and could a relatively rented vehicle by A vehicle which could gather and transmit upper there scientific data could be available by We no new intelligence which either or our estimate in IE that of its air defense weak the is probably also assign ing a very high priority to We estimate that it could develop in a rocket with infrared and in an version with greater their guidance system would permit only tail cone under generally fair weather at the engagement In the could probably have a new New genre partially in IE but does not warrant a change IE stated that also would almost certainly seek to produce in quantity any precision weapon available for effective at For this purpose it could now have available and would probably pro glide due a although limited to good visibility I I Authority In view of its extensive bomber we do not believe that the would produce a surface missile for on Allied and bases over the next several In on the other when we mate that an missile with nuclear could be ready for series there will probably be a high priority Soviet require for a weapon of this type because of the effectiveness of Allied air around key target We have no credible new intelligence either or our mate in IE that will almost certainly have a requirement for for nuclear on Up and Allied coastal It could already have available with nuclear In the could have ready for series production a aircraft with proved and and by its nuclear yield could approach compatibility its accuracy and greatly increase its effect DISCUSSION In IE we that the strategic of the would dictate a major effort in the field of and that the the basic scientific and technical capable to support a research and development We also that the an adequate economic base for a sizeable production because of the limited of the Soviet electronics and precision and other for their output it would almost certainly be un able to produce in the desired all of the for which it an military except over an extended period of Finally we on the basis of the large number of and to be involved in the Soviet missile program and our knowledge of the extensive Soviet exploitation of German size that the Soviet program was an extensive we had no firm intelligence on what specific the was actually or might al ready have in operational The intelligence which become avail able subsequent to IE generally substantiate the above and rein our estimate that an extensive Soviet missile program is In the category of ballistic we now that Soviet progress been what more rapid than previously and that such up to and an will become available at somewhat new evidence that the already on series production of The most significant development in this field is the extensive on what appear to be air defense missile around for probable duplication in report ing we estimate that approximately plexus actually have been The observation of one of these was in with the majority being in late and Of these about have been with sufficient accuracy Annex B add background P it in T to indicate that they are eight to nine nautical and are on two approximately and nautical from the center of Observation in all surrounding not been by calculation based on the above the might consist of to We estimate that about are now with the in various of At the present rate of this entire missile defense system could be operational in late A few of similar install in the initial stage of construction were also in the area in the summer of Each site approximately one mile by mile with three longitudinal about transverse concrete and approximately Each apparently an associated building complex of sufficient size house some From available it is readily apparent that these associated and are well permanent type such as would form a part of a fixed air defense The configure and quality of construction of these appear compatible with their use as missile Certain commonly known as been as a part of of the and probably at every In each case the is lately one mile from the site on the and is generally with the center longitudinal Available information sup that the could be a radar for use in a missile guidance Its antenna configuration and the fact that so many are in each associated site suggest that such a radar would have a high traffic handling Recent indicate that missile like about three in diameter and to in were present at some of the At one site about were seen one in each of the along the transverse The also indicate the existence of an extensive facility to be a and final assembler of for the missile defense system ringing Its identification as a missile sup pier is based on the presence of more than which are similar in size to at air defense missile being around The facility is approximately three to four south of some nautical of the center of We conclude that the install are missile launch ing in support of the defense of and that the now an air defense missile system in at least limited operational We still have no firm evidence as to the specific of the A type of command guidance system probably would be possibly augmented by terminal a guidance system track illumination type a computer and a head might possibly be The missile could have a pay of if terminal were not This weight might be reduced by about to make room for the but this would be for by the increase in Because of its air defense the is almost certainly to give very high priority to By we estimate that a new missile could be ready for series production terminal By at the the could develop low yield nuclear suit able for this missile which would greatly in crease its kill Beyond we believe that the will endeavor to de below with on the order of nautical to the many technical it is highly unlikely that the could develop such until some time after S BALLISTIC of such might have upon their Information on Soviet at the Short The following new Yar missile test range nation our short range ballistic since the publication of missile in IE German in the worked on the A detailed sketch of the area was for a large test stand facility prepared in by five who during the period This test had the range in the fall of During early the prepared a mosaic of the city was being designed for the area nautical of area German aerial and one German to survey and By the sketch with the the site in the fall of for this of the rocket engine static project that several test assembly test would be and that and railroad have been determined as two of them would be capable of testing rocket they in Study of Soviet with thrust up to at Yar also an increase in missile testing in over Our Complete measuring fuel a liquid installation formation that considerable of ballistic are being were no positive Although the information so far available does cation of this been made to not permit of the actual we believe a rocket engine static facility it the scale of the possibly in the This cation is conveniently accessible to a major program and some of our Soviet missile propulsion development center ballistic missile at nautical from where and ton thrust engine have taken Recent Soviet technical indicate that the have an excellent under standing of inertial guidance and associated Soviet interest in inner till is also apparent from assigned the in and from various Soviet into such Inertial guidance are se cure detection and and are ideally to maximize the surprise factor and offensive potential of ballistic We believe the considered the until nation of inertial guidance in its ballistic missile Aside from tactical for support of its field we continue to believe that for the next few the Soviet surface ballistic missile effort will probably be concentrated more upon development of proved than upon quantity production of interim By the growth of the Soviet nuclear stockpile and the probably available would have reduced the significance of any which the accuracy or reliability New intelligence our estimate that is interested in a mile missile but does not substantiate a program for development of a mile We have no evidence of any ballistic available for operational but we continue to estimate as in IE that the could now have operational a mile missile with a nose cone weight of in a pound and a of two for the next few only low yield atomic would be Alternatively the could now have available a missile capable of carrying Such a missile could have a somewhat smaller than the one To counter growing Allied nuclear in the will probably give high priority to a missile system for support of its field The short range to be now available might satisfy this Authority Medium The chief designer at Plant was reportedly a corresponding member of the Department of Technical of the Academy of in His selection to this a high honor in the may cate the successful development of the thrust engine with which he was associated at plant in formation dating back to that this person would be a some honor if the development of the thrust engine was Based on new information and assess of Soviet in the light of Up missile we estimate that a single stage missile the thrust with a range approximately a nose weight of a and a of three to four could be ready for series production sometime during How ever only low yield nuclear would be available for a few after these Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile Analysis of a Soviet demand on a group of German in the spring of to design a missile capable of carrying a of to a range of lead us to the conclusion that the have probably established a require for an intermediate range ballistic size with this range rather than the in IE In the light of more recent nuclear we believe that the weight require would be reduced without change in range Ballistic with of would be capable of reaching all vital in North and from within the By the engine as the booster together with the thrust engine the could develop a missile with a range on the order of a pound nose cone a pound and a of three to four Assuming development was in the probable date at which this missile could ready for series production would be We estimate that a large yield nuclear could be available for it in Such a missile could also provide a research vehicle for training data pertinent to an intercontinental ballistic We also estimate that the above with the same but with the range reduced to could be ready for series production as early as Intercontinental Ballistic Missile We believe an intercontinental ballistic missile would be within Soviet and is probably being on a very Much of the data and experience by the missile program is and necessary to logical to an Such missile could have an range on the order of a pound nose cone a pound and a of roughly five Based on nation acquired on the Soviet missile pro gram since publication of IE we now estimate that the first operational model could be ready for series production by and large nuclear would be available by this Earth Satellite Some time prior to a Permanent mental Commission for Interplanetary was established in the Soviet Academy of The stated purpose of this Commission is to work on the solution of the of cosmic One of its first reportedly will be work for the creation of an automatic laboratory which could re solve around the earth over a long period of time as a Formation of this Commission is the first known official in dilation of a of the retinal involved in a space satellite or in space although many individual Soviet have shown considerable interest in these In Authority SECRET recent by Soviet and indicate a high degree of interest in earth and a Soviet intention to launch one or more such at the practicable We believe that the would place considerable emphasis on such a primarily to achieve logical We estimate that the the basic scientific technical and other to build and launch an unmanned earth satellite A relatively could probably be by A satellite very which could be used to gather and transmit upper atmosphere scientific data would pro able be with Soviet by We believe that the majority of the work of de and an unmanned satellite could be accomplished without significant interference with high priority Soviet missile In addition to the evidence in IE Design Bureau is known to have engaged in research and development work from to on a guidance system for a Soviet designed air missile system There are some that this missile system would have a maximum guidance range of approximately nautical The system was designed to use and radar terminal Prior to approximately six of guidance equipment suitable for testing were by the German group The guidance system under development could be applicable to higher performance surface and is not considered to cause us to change our estate in IE No significant intelligence on become available since the pub location of IE we know that Soviet

the apparently desire to increase In the their trade with the Free absence of substantial or long term from Free World an early expansion of Satellite will be necessary to balance any increase in from the Free This the with the problem of the character and of their and their way of doing in order to improve their position in Free World It will probably be easier for the to in crease trade with the

current Soviet aircraft and that their air are being with those of the the importance which to the area as an advanced line of air Satellite ground constitute increasingly effective along the land to the Western For offensive control of and East the with an ad position for an assault on Western and provide a base from which to operate against the on the northern shore of the Media terranean and against the The Soviet probably regard con tinged control over the as essential to prevent the recreation of a German state of prewar size and which in their view might once again exert dominant influence in Eastern and threaten the security of the or through the the not only East Ger but also the formerly German of and East from which most of the German population was ex in In the eastern of

clear that it incorporation of these into the Soviet Bloc as an accomplished and that the status of the is not a matter for in international In the case of Ger the open the possibility of reunification on the basis of SECRET Authority between the East and West German We that the will not voluntarily relinquish East except in exchange for a solution of the German problem favorable to Soviet It is also possible that the might be willing to reconsider its position with regard to Al For there is a slight chance that the physical isolation of from the Soviet Bloc and its minor strategic value to the Bloc would induce to use as a pawn in Tactical in Soviet Policy in the Soviet policy in the a but generally consistent course since Soviet the area in the wake of the German

persuade political to return The isolation of the Western diplomatic corps was somewhat and a few Western were permitted THE FUTURE Of SOVIET POLICY In THE The now for all practical pur complete control over the Satellite re and will almost certainly be able to maintain it during the period of this Within the in paragraph with respect to East and we believe that it will remain firm Soviet policy to retain such Control funds mentally on the military capability of its domination over the area for an indefinite Soviet control is ever primarily through the Satellite Comma list and by a complex of Soviet diplomatic and military establish economic and police Under the aegis of the Soviet security the various Satellite security have become in effect a part of the Soviet police These are so de as to bind the to the rather than as a The Soviet will continue the policy of the Satellite area in such a way as to produce the possible internal and foreign policy for the This does not preclude Soviet policy calculated to take greater account of local and to smoother comic Such may al so diminish the impact of Soviet rule on Sat elite national and support So that these are Bloc on the importance of for the development of may ported increasing flexibility in and in at a more realistic program of economic development for the area as a Communist control be ing well the can now

aim to a large extent been in the case of the Protest and of the Even the Catholic Church been forced to adopt a policy of open controversy with the in order to conserve the position of its clergy and as much as possible of its trade All available evidence that throughout the Satellite area the have made no appreciable progress in induce ing the people to give active support to the Communist system

Economic Policy Satellite economic policy in the period in a considerable growth of heavy this was polished at the expense of consumer goods and agricultural a con miserable imbalance in heavy index

Satellite are faced with thorny policy in the field of As a matter of they continue to insist that full collectivization of true is a prerequisite for the of so yet they have an acute awareness that rapid and forced collectivization de agricultural production Consequent they can increase agricultural output sig over the next five only if col is carried out at a slow and private agriculture is

We estimate that nonagricultural product will increase by approximately percent in the period This will be made possible by an increase of per cent in the nonagricultural labor force and by an growth in output per worker on the order of two to three percent per The productivity of labor in the Satellite area in will still be considerably less than that of the of the in We estimate that there will be a small in crease in Satellite living by The total population of the is to increase about seven per cent from to approximately from to million Since the increase total agricultural production to only a very small per increase in agricultural output is pro Even with some in of agricultural comparatively little movement in the per consumption of will The diet will remain low in and high in starch and the calorie intake will not be sub spatially consumer goods will account for the major part of the small prospective rise in living Producer goods output will increase at a more rapid rate

trade of the Satellite within the Bloc constant in while their trade with the Free World in During the period of this trade with the Free World may continue to rise somewhat in percentage than total the trade will probably again begin to show an null in will remain the predominant part of the trade of each Sat For political as well as economic the apparently desire to increase their trade with the Free the development of trade with the Free World with the current Soviet drive to extend Communist particularly in the achievement of the of growth and the improvement of living will be significantly if the can import from the Free World certain key such as agricultural iron nonferrous and Some in these are at present em by the In the absence of or from Free which are unlikely to be on any substantial scale during the period of this an early expansion of Satellite will be say to balance an increase in from the Free the are now facing the problem of the character and of their and their way of doing business in order to improve their po in Free World Except in East and to some extent in of the Satellite have been high in cost and indifferent in The large agricultural surplus formerly used by some in their foreign trade have Satellite have a bad reputation in the Free World for abruptly the exchange Of par titular and for unsatisfactory performance on and Under these it will probably be easier for the to increase trade with in the particularly South the Middle and than with the industrial of the Despite this interest in Soviet are also greater stress on the economic integration of the The particular of integration to which they are giving attention are regional ordination of production and a more rational adjustment of the industrial struck true of the Satellite Beginning in the of all the except will cover the same time period as the Soviet and it been officially an that these will be with one another and with the Soviet plan to a greater extent than As in the the will reflect broad economic and laid down by the The Council for Economic Mutual Assistance will probably play the major The apparently hope as a result of closer of production for particular together with a continued high volume of trade and increasing exchange of technical critical in plant or labor can be ing the next five They further hope that the concept of better balanced economic development applied to the area as a with individual on their most efficient economic will increase the of trade and help avoid and bottle Such an adjustment would presume able require the maintenance or elevation of the already high established for padding the output of coal in in and in I Authority equipment in and East Ger and in East and In agriculture the highest would logically be assigned to and the We believe that during the period of this estimate the scope and effectiveness of Bloc wide regional will substantially in crease as to the period Economic interdependence of the elite area already grown significantly through the forced shift of the ing the to trade at the expense of trade with the Free The from such trade could be by further the complementary character of the Satellite The success of these be limited by a number of The task of is intrinsically and its extension will almost certainly encounter practical and doctrinal Central sized and organization of supply on an international scale are much more complex than on a national Greater interdependence will multiply the of plan in in individual While it would be ration al for each country to intensify concentration on its most efficient production it will apparently be at least during the period of this for individual to maintain or even increase their along certain economical pending an production by their Bloc trading Finally the nationalistic and doctrinaire position that each Communist country should concentrate on the develop of heavy industry will probably military against the full acceptance of the concept of interdependent On we view the current stress on economic integration as indicative of a policy which will increasingly finance Satellite development During the period this policy will probably f not contribute greatly to the growth of the economy or to the resolution of basic economic although some can be Over a longer integration may make significant to the economic strength of this SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT During the period Satellite in many of science will con to At the same the will probably cease to be dependent upon the for its basic research and development needs in such as precision optical photographic and This trend will probably result in a general redirection of effort toward the development of for the domestic economy and foreign Since World War East to a lesser

reflecting an supply from domestic The loss of these con may at least temporarily reduce funds for East German instrumentation research and Unless Soviet sup port is East German research and pro auction in this field will depend upon the de development of other trade the in any will pro able be than prior to Competent scientific is still in short but there are many young and research in East Ger and whose are increasing with expert The current trend toward the decent realization of scientific which been noted particularly in East may release a number of from iterative and make them available for more productive While the scientific technical shortage will not be over come during the period of this it will probably be considerably in Id Authority Satellite on the dissemination of information have been and the interchange of such information been Greatly attendance at international scion topic together with an easing of se purity have permitted with scientific on a Such of and

program of assistance to the the supply of nuclear and fashionable Such a if carried would considerably broaden the base and en dance the of the Soviet Bloc in the nonmilitary of nuclear In any the full impact of this program would not be felt before The direct contribution of the to the Soviet Bloc and naval research and development program is of little There is a small amount of work being done in and in East which support to Soviet Soviet how been to limit Satellite research and development work on The have been to apply their scientific and technical effort to the develop of test and

diplomatic and propaganda campaign against At how the are that these will Provided there is no basic change in the German the number of div in East and will pro able not change substantially during the period of the although their combat effectiveness will be through the re equipment and reorganization program which been in progress since late The most significant change in Soviet air strength in the over the past year been a sizeable increase in jet light bomber This substantially Soviet for direct and indirect support of ground force Of light bomber currently in are based in East in and

are See the tables in the Appendix tor detailed fig on the of Satellite military In the case of the figure is In East no cut been in the strength of the military by Satellite security which By days the could mobilize men in provided there was extensive Soviet logistical We do not believe that there will be signify cant in the Satellite standing over the period of the with the exception of the East German If conscription is adopted the latter could be doubled in size to but quality and political reliability would sharply Such a development will probably depend in large part upon the tent of West German There to have been little joint or training Satellite The recent formation of a unified elite armed command only the under which the established Soviet control over military is There is as yet no conclusive evidence of inter Satellite or training under direction of the unified There is no evidence of for tactical integration of Bloc in It is how that is under way and that combined will be within a few In the in the event of general the Satellite would probably be used separately under the direction of the Soviet high command and might be directly under Soviet The morale and reliability of Satellite ground over the past year and will probably continue improve during the period of the This trend will be the result of continued and We believe that the re liability of these is such that they would be unlikely to defect on a substantial scale until victorious Western the Satellite The combat effectiveness of the Satellite considerably so that no generalization is possible

believe that up to percent of Satellite could be employed initially in combat alongside Soviet With Soviet logistical several of the would be capable of sustained index pendant action against

latter included of German Fed real Republic in this have to be used for guarding of communication and in other secondary The Satellite security have not significantly in strength over the past several although they have probably become more It is that they will retain approximately their present status through the period of this and that they will remain capable of protecting the local against any threat of internal The one ex caption to this general capability is provided by East until recent most security were by Soviet security During the past there been a strengthening and reorganization of East German security probably in anticipation of their assuming greater responsibility for The total Satellite output of arms and ammunition will remain a small share of total Soviet Bloc Although these count will manufacture small personal and optical no significant increase in product of army equipment is The Satellite air now have an strength of and an actual strength of operational aircraft of all that by strength will probably be and that actual strength by that date will be nearly Personnel strength is at to be The of the Satellite air will probably be rented as a result of an increase in available aircraft and in the proportion of jet We believe even if the recently are actually car red the air will not be No heavy are to be but piston medium could be made available to the Satellite air as they are out of the Soviet air The stress will continue to be on air with secondary emphasis on air support of ground Throughout the period of the Satellite air will continue to constitute a significant increment to Soviet air strength in The intensive training for carefully selected Satellite in the doc and tactics of the Soviet air Soviet policy to be directed toward the attainment of a high degree of ordination between the air force of each Sat elite and the Soviet air and the integral of the Satellite air into the Soviet air defense There been little ordination among the Satellite air SECRET I Authority F C R F While the Eastern Defense Pact that such is probably no significant prog less in this direction will be We mate that the policy of close Soviet control the Satellite air will continue of through After the Polish defection of the its control over flying in all Satellite air Concord there were to improve personnel selection and political Emphasis was also upon the of each Satellite air force in the defense of its own thus the national in These have the po political reliability of the Satellite air We believe that the combat effectiveness of these air is such that they could be em in a defensive role in the event of general war and would have some offensive traditional particularly against Combat aircraft production in the now for percent by number and five percent by airframe weight of Bloc This share will probably increase to percent by number and seven percent by weight by We believe that aircraft now being produced in the Soviet Union will gradually replace obsolescent els on Satellite production after the So have converted to For we estimate that the the only jet fighter now being produced in the will be out and will probably be by the FRESCO jet fighter in and in Po land by The FRESCO will pro able be out after about three and be by either the FARMER jet the FLASHLIGHT fighter or or by The BEST a ground attack was out in in and it is that the production of a light jet probably the BEAGLE will begin in The BEAGLE will probably be out by about and be by a new light jet A new plant under

foreign policy with particular respect to to estimate Bloc to support a policy of expanding economic with these and to mate the susceptibility of to these The new Bloc which been increasing vigor since the spring of the ever genre of the Bloc as a formidable editor with the West in the and cultural For and influence among the under The Bloc it self as a defender of peace and as a proponent of mutually beneficial real with the outside A key element of the current Bloc been an unprecedented effort to establish a wide range of economic real with The Bloc is two basic cond in the the large extent to which the economic hood of most on the production and export of used colonial intended to encompass South east South the Middle North Tropical and raw and and the desire of most of the un to accelerate comic development while simultaneously increasing welfare and consume Within the past there been a marked increase in Bloc trade with these The Bloc is offering capital equipment and technical in ex change for bulk of raw and It also some low medium and long term to finance the export of capital goods and We are unable to estimate with son the extent to which the Bloc will be willing or able to expand its economic with the It the capability to supply a wide range of capital goods and and a stage of economic develop in which the exchange of capital goods for raw and Authority will tend to result in a net economic By it likely that total Bloc trade with the under will be around billion annually double the If Bloc economic continue to expand present rate and follow the general pattern of they will alleviate some of the immediate economic of a number of un particularly and Bloc trade and credit will probably not facilitate a substantial degree of comic development in any of the under with the possible ex caption of and A number of in which a few constitute an part of their may de below a degree of economic dependence on the Bloc out of proportion to the per of their trade with the the total political effect of the new Bloc toward is not necessarily proportional to the extent of economic with these In Bloc tactics are already important political effects in the The image of the Bloc as a principal proponent of peace and dis armament and as a benefactor of the become red able to many people in this Exist ing neutrality have been rein forced and several how with the West have begun to weigh the of a more The availability of Bloc led some to believe that they are now in a position to bargain with the West for The availability of Bloc aid to the aberration of the Up concern with the Bloc threat in neutrality led to of neglect from and the Several of the with the West have become suffix gently with Bloc of peace to become critical of Up emphasis on military aid and have for in economic Bloc tactics have also to the mounting against maintenance of Western trade If the Bloc its present tactics over the next few present political in the In are likely to be the appeal of neutrality will probe by grow in and the of and the Pact na to regional security will probably be ing the West and the Bloc will probably be further blurred in the of the of many of the There will probably be less prevention over the threat of major war or Communism greater concern over regional and local there will still be on the ability to influx once or manipulate the of the With the posse exception of trade with the Bloc will probably remain consider able smaller than trade with must the experience of the Up in the postwar period that close economic with the can be a source of friction as well as political Authority Although the people and of some may distrust the Up more than the the of even the neutrality have had to with Communist to power and they will be watchful accord ing to their own of the cone of dealing with the If the Bloc should make early to ex plot the growing economic dependence of or to tain political contrary to the de or of local these would probably react by to reduce or break off their with the particularly if Western made known their willingness to assist the nation involved through the adjustment These will probably cause the Bloc to proceed with caution and to em phase to gain the good will and confidence of key indigenous and Weighing general Bloc assets and we believe that the ability to influence in the area is likely to increase sig over the next few By itself with these on colonial by expanding economic and by other logical and political the Bloc may be able to increase Communist once and to weaken significantly the role of the West in the Although there is no substantial immediate danger that the will be drawn formally into the Bloc through these over the longer term an in number of may reach the already by a where their foreign parallel or actually support the Bloc on most key In a few the way may lately be prepared for actual Comma list through coercion or in eternal If present Bloc are many of the will probably come increasingly to regard the and Communist China as capable of the international The count will probably enter into such comic or political with the Bloc as on to further their own national they will continue in to be responsive to the West because of long established and political The lasting political effects of the new Bloc on will depend heavily upon the degree to which the West is genuinely interested their their and to their DISCUSSION THE RECENT EVOLUTION Of POLICY The Bloc sought with in vigor and especially since the spring of to portray the Bloc as a defender of peace and as a proponent of mutually beneficial and cultural with the outside A wide range of diplomatic and propaganda been at reducing apprehend of the likelihood of general and at from Bloc policy the stigma of subversive and agree son which was largely responsible for the Authority miserable measure of free world unity in the postwar The Bloc is also to present the current world struggle as one of peaceful competition between the out model and weakening of Capitalism and the increasingly strong and of It become increasingly evident that the new proceeds primarily from a grad development by the Communist leadership of a basic appraisal of the world have apparently that under present the of major war are so great that mile try pressure or local aggression which in solve significant of such a war cannot constitute a part of rational and Free World and the are more vulnerable to various of political and economic than to violence and of These judge probably provide the basis for the re of doctrine at the Congress of the Soviet Communist Party on the in viability of the role of violence in must and the admissibility of alternative to The likely hood that the on which Communist are now based will not fundamentally change in the foreseeable plus the taken to provide the new policy with adequate doctrinal indicate that current Communist tactics are likely to continue for some time to since the death of Soviet have also been their comic In this they probably that Soviet economic de development had the stage at which an expansion of especially with under would help to meet growing Bloc needs for agricultural and other raw At the same they that an expansion of trade could be an effect time instrument of the new policy of person The present phase of Bloc policy is in to cultivate in the free world which will permit expansion of must An initial objective of Bloc is to convince of the Western that the new Communist policy the danger of Communist agree thus removing the prime motivation of those They hope thus de proved of their the will filter in their joint military and lately be The also hope that their current posture will lessen Western and increase Communist influence in the Current Communist tactics are designed to advance Communist long ten without semi risk of major TACTICS In The of the world which are now being wood by the Communist Bloc

only a small percentage of the index trial they account for about per cent of world Through trade some of the play important in the economy of the free Although there are wide in and political within this vast the general atmosphere is one of political instability from a complex process of rapid economic and cultural Nationalist feeling is intense and reaction against foreign influence or domino is Increasing awareness of social and economic backward ness is causing unrest and and there is a widespread desire for an increase in the standard of In many there are oppressive or weak political which are increasingly incapable of coping with the complex From these common and on the basis of race and a sense of identity among many of these and they tend to stand together in block on many international Authority J Political Tactics The Bloc is the under by itself with anti colonial and nationalist Nearly all of the have at some time in their history come under the domination of one or another of the Western Even those which have been led by or common interest to align themselves with the West are prone to be suspicious Western In the and Communist although in some by their part support of armed Communist are now free to a considerable degree of the podium of The Soviet record of imperialism in the Basic Eastern Eu is not well understood in the Only a few of the experienced direct from the Bloc and the virulent propaganda on Western imperialism have led some of them to believe that with the Bloc can act as a counterweight to Western influence or the threat of The Bloc is to cultivate friendly with some formerly as in Communist by sympathy with their special national In particular the Bloc support or encouragement to count that are involved in local in for or in especially where the opposing party is with the The Bloc a considerable degree of maneuverability in these unlike the it is free of to the colonial and because the Soviet record of imperialism is not well The Bloc also its to identify Up policy with danger of war and the with the hope of it that present world particularly the growth of Soviet give of lasting normalization of international real Most of the have a great fear of major war and they desire to remain also from international power and to devote their to in eternal development and local They tend to be critical of Up to extend the area of military and to be recap time to Bloc of peaceful The Bloc is the similarity of its past and present economic with those of the The have the success of their in rapidly transforming their own backward into industrial through socialist organization and the full The mobilization of domestic appeal of Communist experience is particular ly strong in where many of the educated elite have been conditioned to think along in many the of individual freedom and democratic are weak and thus do not serve as an effective barrier to the acceptance of authoritarian Even where the Communist cost in human suffering is there is a temptation to believe that appropriate of the system could be without serious damage to political and human The private enterprise system to be associated with the in equality and exploitation of colonial Throughout most of the a large measure of state control of the economy is accepted as both desirable and The are to play down the antidemocratic of their pro By their doctrine as the embodiment of progressive social they hope to gain the support of other of social particularly the Socialist par Their aim is to end the isolation of the Communist and to provide a basis for with and National An important element of the appeal in the is its relative free dom from the saint of discrimination against colored which is in some by the fact that one of the major in the Bloc is a nonwhite By Authority racial in colonial and in some of the Up are bitterly by many and Economic Tactics A key element of the current Bloc policy been an unprecedented effort to establish a wide range of economic with un This economic pro gram included new and expanded a modest and selective credit and a growing emphasis on the training and prove son of and The Bloc is two basic in the under the large extent to which the economic livelihood of most on the production and export of raw and and the desire of most of the to accelerate comic development while simultaneously in welfare and The even under the most favorable economic in eternally and in world lack the re to carry through a rapid program of economic They generally lack sufficient trained personnel plan and integrate a development prize their monetary and fiscal to channel internal to essential invest and install and operate transport and Few of the have sufficient capital for the voltage of investment

investment and In their export earning capacity is inadequate to finance of capital equipment while the min mum import of consumer goods necessary to restrict and ally pop lar Progress in development

Bloc Economic We believe that the Bloc will seek to expand substantially both its and its trade with while ing every effort to live up to In doing the Bloc will seek below significant economic with a greater number of but will probably continue to weight its quantitative toward a relatively few count particularly those wherein it the for political The distribution of Bloc trade will also be affected to a lesser degree by growing needs for selected strategic raw for bauxite and industrial Authority The Bloc is almost certainly not to undertake foreign economic of such magnitude and content as to stimulate substantial economic development in any country except possibly in certain peripheral such as and In the latter the Bloc may desire to develop showcase of the of close real with the In a number of other may have a limiting effect on the scope of the economic program in the next few In their with some the Bloc encounter administrative and psychology cal The extension of the Bloc program will also depend to some extent on how successfully the Bloc can compete with Western enterprise and technology in these the Bloc will probably wish to avoid itself in the early of the program in view of the political importance it will attach to its in some the must weigh its economic out side the Bloc against the for economic development within the We are unable to estimate with precision the extent to which the Bloc will be willing or able to expand its economic with the By it likely that total Bloc trade with the will be around billion annually double the To reach such a level would a rate of increase about equal to that of total Bloc trade with from and below the rate of increase with the In any it is clear that the Bloc will increasingly offer serious and competition to the West as a market and as a source of capital and technical PROBABLE EFFECTS Of TACTICS The new Bloc policy the emergence of the Bloc as a formidable competitor with the in the and biological for position influence among many of the The Bloc now a posture of an attitude of sympathetic understanding of the needs and of the and a system of cultural and political attractive to many of intellect talk and political It to the impressive record of Soviet industrial growth as a model for the economic development of backward In the Bloc sent itself as being capable of cap and technical Although the ultimate of the Bloc remain its immediate are probably merely to increase the attract of neutrality and to expand Bloc in to For Economic Effects The Bloc already made significant progress in expanding its economic with a number of most notably and The for this success have varied from country was receptive to Bloc largely because of its inability to dispose of its large rice surplus in Western was able to obtain certain capital equipment from the Bloc on more attractive than were available in the could not obtain the arms it desired from Western and to bolster its position The receptivity of other to Bloc will be conditioned by similar which are with the West or have close economic with Western count or receive substantial aid from the will wish to these even these are likely to increase their trade with the particularly if the neutrality appear to be from the key and have already done so because of internal economic and numerous and the will probably investigate the for in In some trade with the the primary motive will be to increase export but in the purpose may be to elicit additional support and attention from the Authority J Given equal and credit fa there is little desire among under for Bloc trade in prefer once to Free World On the Western trade foreign exchange usable in other while most with the Bloc are on a carter Thus the basic appeal of the Bloc market is as a source of ex port earnings not available in the Free World which can be used to obtain capital goods from the In view of receptivity to Bloc trade would probably weaken if the Bloc were to major of bulk bought from the if the Bloc up to agree the and is discreet in its meddling in the internal of ether most of the will increasingly accept Bloc at face There will probably be a and in some increase in the level of normal in dependence on Soviet tech and in the extent to which the various will be willing to mortgage their through long term credit from the the readiness of neutrality and independent to purchase arms from the Bloc will probably If the Bloc economic should con to expand at the present rate and low the present general pattern of concentrate they will alleviate some of the immediate economic of a number of under for and In these and possibly several Bloc could have a effect on export and could assist in income and employment in key A number of in which a few constitute an important part of their may develop a degree of economic dependence on the Bloc out of pro portion to the percentage of their trade with the At the same Bloc trade and credit will probably not facilitate a substantial degree of economic development in any of the with the possible exception of and This is so primarily because the magnitude of capital generally far that likely to be on the basis of entry Bloc trade and Political Effect The total political effect of the new toward is not necessarily proportional to the extent of economic with these In a few a high proportion of trade with the Bloc may not be by any substantial shift in orientation and internal in other sit the reverse may be true al though the economic relationship may be small in percentage or quantity the shift in political alignment may be In Bloc tactics are already ing important political effects in the The image of the Bloc as a print final proponent of peace and disarmament and as a benefactor of the become credible to many people in this neutrality have been and several now with the West have begun to weigh the of a more posture The availability of Bloc assistance led some to believe that they are now in a position to bargain with the West for The availability of Bloc aid con tribute to the aberration of the Up concern with the Bloc threat in neutrality led to of neglect from and the Several of the with the West have become sufficiently with Bloc of peace to become critical of Up emphasis on military aid and have for economic Bloc tactics have also to the mounting against the maintenance of Western trade If the Bloc its present tactics over the next few present political in the are likely to be In the appeal of neutrality will probably grow in and the of and Authority E E the Pact to regional security will probably be dividing the West and the Bloc will probably be further blurred in the of the of many of the There will probably be less apple tension over the threat of major war or autism and greater concern over regional and local The new Bloc diplomacy and its economic will provide the Bloc for government off and intellectual by direct per Because socialism is favorably in many especially in the psychological and video logical effects of Bloc economic may be more profound than been the case with Western aid Although Comma as an open political force is not in most of the the postwar generation of young may ignore the history of accept the present line of and develop a close sense of identification with Communist China and the At the same the new look in Soviet the designation of who been with the of and Communist to the world socialist movement may help to increase the influence of the local Communist In and other of the Middle East and the too frequently feel that they can with the as long as it their pur pose and then drop The danger in the progress which the may make in infiltration of the of the the and intellectual during the period of there will still be important on the ability to influence or manipulate the of the With the possible exception of trade with the Bloc will probably remain considerably smaller than trade with the ex experience of the Up in the postwar period that close economic with the can be a source of as well as political Al though the people and of some under may distrust the Up more than the the of even the relist have had to with must to power and they will be watchful according to their own the of dealing with the If the Bloc should make early to ex plot the growing economic dependence of or to obtain polite cal contrary to the or inter of local these would probably react by to reduce or break off their with the particularly if Western made known

same important will work against an increase in the strength of domestic Communist of by local have been by the nationalist in North and and The local probably will not be able to escape completely from the distrust surrounding their which from of open conflict with local It is possible that the transition to united front tactics in some will reduce the vitality of the indigenous must and subject them to ing internal a major part of any credit for economic progress derived from Bloc assistance is likely to be taken by the of the To the extent that there is economic it will tend to alleviate certain chronic habit rally by the domestic and to provide constructive employment for the young who in all are the most dissatisfied with and form the primary tar get of Communist Authority To the extent that it sides in the of other the Bloc will tend to alienate one side or the other and reduce its influence The Soviet Union already found it awkward to take a position in the between the and the North While seeming to favor the against the it so far re trained from going anything like all the way in doing It may find it expedient in the future not to repeat the firm stand it took on and in Almost as it is drawn into the of other the Soviet Union will find that it is disappointing at least as many as it is Weighing general Bloc assets and limit times and apart from the major dis cursed it that the ability to influence in the area is likely to increase significantly over the next few By itself with these on colonial by expanding economic and by other and political the Bloc may be able to weaken significantly the role of the West in the Although there is no substantial immediate danger that the will be drawn into the Bloc through these over the longer term an increasing number of the already may by a where their foreign parallel or actually support the Bloc on most key In a few the way may lately be prepared for actual Communist through coercion or internal sub reach Effect of a Communist If the were to any under the effect on must influence would vary according to the particular If a legit mate government were by violence or the image of respectability which the Bloc is striving so assiduously to build up would be seriously This effect would be much less marked in a case where the regime unseated by the Comma was considered a Western puppet or otherwise representative nationalist or if came to power by In apparently legitimate electoral the reaction of other would probably be determined largely by the manner in which the new re itself with respect to

some time been difference of opinion among Soviet about the policy of seeking to apathy at disaffection in the and distrust in the Soviet confidence in this by gains in morale at home and an position

to take in it is unlikely that they will wish drastically to reverse the course of domestic relaxation which was for pressing internal and significantly party and popular It is also unlikely that Soviet will abandon the effort to woo the of the world and to weaken Western So armed action in the crisis will have an adverse effect on the credibility of the propaganda exploitation of final but the ultimate effect in this as well as on the of the and of Satellite will be determined more by future Soviet policy than by the present emergency Policy Toward the Evidence at present does not

conflict ing in the than in the where Communist authority was less securely established and particularly in and Communist had to with of intense national ism and a rise in popular early among the Soviet evidently to recognize the strength of feeling within some of the Satellite Communist They do not seem to have that the reduction of terror and the rehabilitation of would not only stimulate intraparty criticism but would also involve and lead to the expression of and This ess led to a breakdown of party unity in and and an acceleration of the reform movement to a point where Soviet were acute so in IMMEDIATE By the beginning of the faced in a direct choice between wholesale repression and the emergence of an The latter would have seriously the Soviet strategic position in Eastern the prestige of the world Communist move and an unacceptable precedent for other Under these we believe that the diversion provided by the attack on while did not affect the character or the of the Soviet resort to military repression in In the immediate the will face the bitter hostility of the people and the probability of considerable dis order within The party will almost certainly have to rely heavily on direct Soviet support for the formidable of order and un undertaking This prevent the to independence any government from being accepted by the Once open resistance in is the will seek to a regime which does not depend obviously on direct Soviet military It may mate that the emergence of such a regime will be a state of physical and psychological exhaustion among disillusionment because support from the West or the Up did not measure up to and economic and limited political and the auction of more acceptable into the for some time to come the is likely to feel that local Communist are so weak and unreliable that a worsening of the Soviet hold would risk a new attempt to leave the The resist proven and Evidence of substantial to the to the growing likelihood that emergency military may have to be by more permanent and far reaching repressive if the authority of a puppet government is to be established in At there is no firm basis for the for continued effective resistance in We believe that the will not succeed during the next few in local Authority Communist authority able to govern without the presence of Soviet in substantially than before the If the should conclude that it was unable to find any body of indigenous variant able both to establish effective rule over the people and to satisfy minimum Soviet it might be forced to administer the country for a pro period by military Such a situation would constitute a clear defeat for the whole policy of in the would pose a latent threat to the uneasy equilibrium in and would compromise the

the Polish press and spontaneous and the appearance of outside effective Communist Polish divergence from the in a Up vote and the are themselves with campaign against must extend this Although substantial agree was apparently in the recent the might if the disturbing within are not more effectively that either the will or the capability to impose the essay discipline within the party and the It clear from the example that the would intervene for city to prevent a change in inter national and at least in part for that the are unlikely to demand such a change in the near It is not clear what short of this might induce the to intervene forcibly of Soviet have had the effect of threatening such intervention ing the past Because of strategic the would pro able intervene with force in before deterioration went as far as it did in If the Soviet do not intervene by force or by threat of they will at least attempt to work gradually within the Polish party to restore the influence of

over the long the present and future in will give rise to serious to Soviet control in other For widespread in would be seen by them as detrimental to in the other THE The same basic tension between

will probably not prevent agitation and vigorous of Much will depend on whether a clear line of since the preservation of Communist party unity and discipline is the first requirement for the stability of these One important obstacle to extensive further will be the apprehension of most present Satellite party that such would undermine their own political EFFECTS Of SOVIET POLICY OR THE In foreign and internal in the the Soviet appear not to have had any clear picture of what the effects would be in the They apparently felt that a series of cautious to local could be without en wandering vital Soviet or causing which would require a return to police A difficult appraisal S almost certainly been by the serious set back to Soviet prestige in and by the continued in a satin factory and workable formula for both and The for important in or both han markedly in view of the serious that are almost certainly now being felt in the On the one in have almost certainly led many in the other to urge to adopt a harder Such a line of policy almost certainly strong in the for this view within the Soviet leadership itself can be not only from known opposition to the rehabilitation of but also from renunciation of the Polish reform movement at the moment of access son to and from the publication of an speech in on the eve of the visit to On the other an appreciable number of Communist some of the Soviet probably be live that the recent in and were basically the result not of the new Soviet in the period but rather of hesitant in moving toward a clearly defined new form of association with the which would be less degrading to This line been ex explicitly by and the and to have received some support from the although the desire for greater liberalization on the part of the Satellite and the support which they receive from the of many undo fitted a less direct form of pressure on the Soviet Soviet Authority S C civil T foreign policy may be obliged to more account of these in the present world Alternative Despite these contradictory there will almost certainly be a consensus among the Soviet that vital Soviet demand preservation of Soviet he memory in the Satellite They will al most certainly continue to believe that the military security the forward deployment of Soviet secure communication to these and utilize of the area for Soviet air Loss of control over the might find West a press ing against the Soviet A defection of the area from the would also be seen a major setback to the must cause world and would seriously compromise the effectiveness of Soviet for sign policy in and the Middle comic would be a factor of though not critical Given the vital character of the the Soviet will not seriously consider their dominant position in At the other end of the a return to the of rule is highly the major of action from which the Soviet will have to choose in dealing with their current are likely to be the A determined policy of firm Soviet re but to avoid the of Such a policy would probably involve strengthening the position of the Sat elite most subservient to posing a freeze on further to Sat elite and either to intimidate into his pro or to overthrow his regime in This policy would require depend once on either the Soviet military or the secret while at the same time it would increase latent it would impede any increase in Satellite productive would weaken the Soviet campaign to increase political and economic influence outside the and might lead to a break with It might require in the Soviet A deliberate and systematic redefine of based on less er and participatory to nationalist Such a policy would involve acceptance of as a model for other extensive in the leadership of other Satellite Communist and a systematic effort gradually to on the basis of economic broad ideological and common stra topic Such a policy of worsening if gradual and focus would weaken the position of who are loyal to and often would probably encourage nationalist to the which the can and might create under which some of the would eventually attempt to dis themselves from the Continuation of the present course of between and Such a which would be essentially a policy of clear would seek to stabilize the sit nation in the within broad to for change when they become dominant within a Satellite but the power and intention to intervene forcibly if the international alignment of any Eastern state peaked in Such a course would sans local within the Satellite em It would probably not solve the basic problem of reconciling Soviet control with the development of stable and productive re in the Satellite Soviet policy during the past few to have the third course of an uneasy balance be teen reconciliation and This pol icy could continue On the other the recent agreement with Authority S and even the made by the Radar regime in indicate that there must be within the Soviet leadership to move toward a systematic policy of concession it is not certain that the for a policy of reconciliation will prevail over in certain Soviet party and military to fall back on of repression when con fronted with Western on the in the wake of the up rising and public to influence Soviet policy may make a policy of psychologically difficult for the Soviet We believe that for the present the Soviet are unable or unwilling to exercise a clear option for either a systematic policy of repression or of further cones they are most likely to continue an decisive course It is possible at any time that the in or a change within the Soviet leadership would lead to the adoption of Course In the long the at work both within and without the Soviet empire probably Soviet to kept Course B as the basic pattern for their with the Satellite Even in this the when it insist on a voice in commensurate with its relative military and economic strength within the Regardless of which alternative is the will almost certainly continue to offer various economic to the and will attempt to strengthen Bloc economic There is also likely to be in consultation on a wide range of policy any one of alternative Soviet will be with serious practical A policy of reconciliation will be handicapped in most Sat by the difficulty of keeping reform with in A program of repression through puppet will incur some of the of and will be faced in many with the acute problem of finding enough reliable and efficient nous party to conduct such a A policy of continued improvise between the two will suffer the dead

worsening of police following the death of The Soviet are great difficulty in and into effect which will reduce this crisis to manageable believe that the will continue to regard the Satellite area as vital to its and will not seriously enter at least for the next several the possibility of a general political or military even in return for a withdrawal of Up from To the Soviet loss of control over Eastern would constitute a severe setback for They would also view it as rendering them powerless to prevent German and as seriously the strategic We believe that the Soviet have from the of recent

NATURE Of THE PROBLEM The political stability Communist re in the Satellite area upon the interplay of a variety of The most basic of these are the nature and degree of the pressure applied by the on

economic na and of Satellite regarding policy also play a All these were at work in the crisis of recent will continue to be and must be taken into account in the future for Satellite political SOVIET POLICY TOWARD THE Basically it was the conflict between Soviet in the and the national of the individual which gave rise to the recent crisis in the Satellite The immediate cause of the crisis was the simultaneous weakening of ideological authority and worsening of police losing the death of These gave rein to opposition the strength and determination of which were apparently un The by of was probably the Soviet taken primarily with a view to internal Soviet On the other the rap procurement with was as was the guarded endorsement of to for foreign policy outside the Insofar as the Soviet con ordered the of these with in the they apparently that these could be turned to their own advantage or at least to curb the of police terrorism were probably intended actually to broaden pop lar support for the Satellite and to stimulate initiative and the deterioration of Soviet authority and security the the prestige and the cohesiveness of some of the Satellite ruling and the emergence of anti and reformist within tain of the Satellite Communist par and other among the population felt it possible to speak out more openly against economic and other These led to uneasy ness throughout the Satellite to a break down of party unity and open expression of feeling in and in the to rebellion against the Communist The upheaval in two and rum in were not the result of SECRET A th SECRET tied which had become virtually under Satellite of relaxation permitted and their moderation of certain previous led to a more open and spontaneous expression of reformist and even of some call after the Soviet of Even this primarily among communist party only in and did wide of the base call population eventually become With the probable except of there is at present no known widespread organization of in the articulate opposition been largely confined to reformist within the Communist the state bu and semiofficial organized such as trade So long as the Satellite leadership remain maintain police and stay closely to reformist sen can only express itself in cautious advocacy of the need for national from the Soviet and cannot openly attack Communist as De in and that when a Communist regime the public expression of nationalist of the resulting agitation can rapidly transform itself into political which are tally especially if the re is divided and We believe that the Soviet are determined to maintain their domination of the Satellite This determination con times despite their awareness of the potent till strength of opposition and their appraisal of the especially in of control force particularly in of open In the Soviet there are probably three main which make control of the area The political and ideological in investment in the myth of world advance is so great that defect from the of any lite possibly would represent a setback for the world Communist Such a especially if lower by in other would not only impose severe on Soviet foreign policy but would arose Soviet of Western to exploit the Even it would probably give rise to unrest in the itself which might lead to a challenge to the authority of the Soviet The Satellite area must continue to be available for Soviet military Even if the Soviet came in time to believe that they no longer to maintain large Soviet there to oppose a son or to mount offensive they would still insist on use of the area for Soviet air They would almost certainly be live that they could not count upon the of the area as a forward or buffer zone if they permitted independent govern to replace the present Loss of control over the Satellite area would make it impossible for the to prevent unification of or to exert major influence over the future policy of a This would represent abandonment one of the principal of Soviet postwar policy in with the conflict between So and Satellite the Soviet have found to form late which reduce this conflict to manageable For a time they at a policy of listening direct

now believe that they can make some economic without running this and they will probably continue to make such even at the cost of sacrificing production A special Soviet policy is in Po where the no longer direct control over Polish internal The Soviet are trying to regain this con but the faction in the Polish Communist party is not now strong enough SECRET obtain compliance with Soviet The of force by the against the remove would almost certainly be by bulk of the Polish nation and armed The result would probably be the t of Soviet in which could spread to East and thus provoke a major

enough to de the regime from on essential Soviet security The re will therefore continue to make its history available for Soviet military in particular a secure line of to East and to refrain from openly opposing the and other Communist on international The Soviet will probably accept this arrangement for the time since it their mum security and the continued existence of a Communist regime in In our this arrangement will represent a solution satisfactory to the Soviet It is at any they will conclude that their for imposing full authority by limited are and that in are becoming in increasingly dangerous to the They might then decide to apply major political and comic and might eventually pro to military We believe it more likely that they will proceed more deliver by taking advantage of economic and political and upon his dependence on the for military and economic they can rebuild the faction within the Polish party and armed and restore a more reliable Communist As a part of this other Communist have been employed to put ideological pressure on the A major problem for the Soviet if the present more nationalist leadership in consolidated its will be to prevent Polish from spreading to other In many re press with the the role of trade and factory worker agricultural collectivization and procurement political activity by the allocation of product to consumer the Polish regime is already heretic in of some of the and which prevail else where the The question which the So as well as the of other Sat must ask themselves is whether these from the hitherto

the in could lead to of doctrine and practice elsewhere which would ultimately be very difficult for the authoritarian Communist creed to Not least of the Soviet would be concerned that the heresy could spread rapidly to the they will maintain steady pressure on the Polish regime to keep its reformist within an acceptable margin of It is this same concern with the danger of ideological deviation which led the to drop for the time being its effort to associate more closely with the The Soviet probably believe that while not a primary to the in Warsaw and They probably also believe that their willingness to receive with high and their eager to party the belief in the Satellite that the was willing to tolerate independent nationalist tender The polemic with since the make clear that the Soviet intend to repair their previous They probably feel that it is essential to resume the ideological isolation of F but in order to avoid strengthening with the West and neutrality they

steady buildup of its nuclear They probably estimate that the Up will seek to deploy its nuclear within effective range of their key to increase the number of and to include in this de employment as these are and The Bloc reaction to Up deployment of nu clear included both military and political The military reaction been an integral part of the general Bloc military which included a con winning emphasis on nuclear designed in part to deter Up attack S and on defensive against Up de livery the Bloc have sought to regard or reduce Up deploy by a continuous propaganda and campaign at associated

NUCLEAR THE PROBLEM To estimate whether the would attempt to evade a nuclear test moratorium beginning and to assess the capability of present and future detection to identify and provide evidence of an We believe if the to a moratorium on nuclear its initial policy will be to abide by the of the We believe this because the Soviet not only would not wish to receive the opprobrium which would follow a violation but because they probably would hope that the effect of the moratorium would give them political and strategic During the early days of the moratorium they pro able would not be seriously to deviate from this in the light of our judgment between now and they have sufficient time to complete the they probably feel essential and The Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee is separately a report which in detail the importance to the of continued testing and detection The Soviet probably have a fairly accurate estimate of present Up detection They would organize that some of would al most certainly be They would probably also realize that some could not be and that in some it could not be that were nuclear in there would be some uncertainty in Soviet of their ability to escape detection and proof of their contrary to our present the had not their mum testing program prior to the entry into effect of the moratorium or as the period of the moratorium they for much more effect time and economical we still believe it unlikely that the would evade the prohibition except by ways they considered unlikely to be de We wholly blue the possibility that they would take some We conclude that the Soviet would almost certainly regard the cal of getting caught red handed as except ex extraordinary Such might be either a clear opportunity to gain a great advantage over the Up in nuclear through some now unforeseen or a situation in which the had a clear advantage over the If such did we believe the Soviet would quite possibly not observe the moratorium since they would probably feel that the military to be by testing would outweigh any adverse political They would probably attempt to size the political of son by false prior to open renunciation of the in the hope of the West to take the initiative itself in DISCUSSION SOVIET In AGREEING To A MORATORIUM Active exploitation of the disarmament issue is one of the key of present Soviet external The clearly this issue not only as an essential part of its pose of even more as a possible of Western nuclear striking power and its withdrawal from around the periphery of the It is probably also con over the potential threat to its in from Up and mile try power in For these the to concentrate on such dis armament as nuclear test suspend a ban on use of nuclear liquid of foreign and troop from By its on such the clearly to encourage the relaxation of Western defense help undermine and create among its and above all create a climate West use of nuclear In addition the is probably concerned about the nor mouse cost of its military establishment and would welcome a measure of disarmament which would permit some diversion of to meet other pressing may also have some concern over the possible de development of nuclear by particularly in we do not believe that either of the latter two would be compelling in Soviet think In agreeing to a nuclear test moratorium the would be by the belief that such an agreement would be an import want first step toward these Soviet in the field of Through its consistent and unambiguous advocacy of a test ban the already con miserable propaganda It would gain much further credit if were actually especially in the of the con miserable number of in all who favor such a ban out of concern with atmospheric pollution or as a first step to ward curling the danger of nuclear The Soviet pose as the exponent of dinar moment would thus be Above a nuclear test ban would create lately a greater psychological barrier to the use of nuclear and over the longer Soviet policy toward disarmament is more comprehensively in of IE in and term offer the prospect of increasing for legally the use of nuclear At the same the would recognize that a test moratorium would not prevent it from to manufacture fashionable to apply tested to new to improve its delivery and to continue research and development for testing at the end of the AFFECTING THE FEASIBILITY AND LIKELIHOOD Of EVASION Whether the Soviet would attempt to evade a test moratorium agreement would depend largely upon the relative they attached to the following the political of getting the to be from further and the effectiveness of the system in and pro during evidence of an The Political If a violation by the were demon to the satisfaction of the bulk of the free world the Soviet propaganda po and peaceful pose would suffer substance and the would jeopardize the gains it sought in agreeing to a mora The Soviet would probably recognize under such they would alienate much of the support and acceptance they have won in that defense in West would probably be and that the Up in particular would resume its test More it the were clearly shown to have in bad the would be greatly reduced that other would accept a more preventive agreement which would gain for the the more important of forcing a retraction of Up military power and legally the of nuclear The Military Study of the of the Soviet nuclear which have been clearly that the tested a wide range of fundamental that it a high level of sophistication in both theory and and that it now an extensive capability to pro due a family of capable of satisfying to a reasonable extent most of its major mile try The almost certainly still a great need for further testing in order to improve current and to develop certain additional of

be able to improve their current to remove to develop efficient air defense and to develop making more economical use of fashionable On the other they probably would not be able to plate the necessary either to refine these or to assure the most economical use of fashionable We believe the would regard the above as the minimum necessary prior to a test and that they would probably carry through the intensive if they were now prepared to kept a moratorium effective on or now forest such a moratorium as contrary to our they should fail to carry through this minimum they would probably attempt to postpone the entry into effect of the moratorium until the say were On the assumption that their minimum testing program was Soviet Specific Soviet nuclear and the associated with them are In detail

entirely thermonuclear They might regard such as desirable to reduce the dan gers of or to reduce local contamination in where a sur face burst is desired or where might affect territory or future

Soviet pro able do not have an urgent requirement to develop during a test mora thorium In other might arise as a result of new new or other unforeseen Effectiveness of the System The Soviet view of the effectiveness of the system would play an important role in any Soviet decision regarding evasion of a test moratorium since it will establish the degree of risk which the Soviet would have to accept in carrying out various of The problem two the fact of an explosion and that an explosion was nu In both the ultimate test is the production of usable evidence convincing to other At the

to its reliability for air might be un able to detect at in In the case of excess of about in some other unique environs such as deep underground or under the fact of an explosion might be de primarily by seismic but there would be difficulty in separating such from natural In IE and Probable In the March we that the could probably develop a missile system of some belly against the for

In the Northern Hemisphere In not remote from the Conceivably could be staged In remote such as Antarctica or southern but such would probably be by the since various Intelligence collection would be almost certain to spot the which would be with test not the test In order to establish conclusively that a given explosion was nuclear in it is necessary to obtain radioactive This is generally possible for between the surface and the tropopause substantial fission in unique and entirely or almost entirely thermonuclear might not produce radioactive debris that could be collected in sufficient to establish the fact of a nuclear under any known or fore stable In order to estimate the likelihood of a Soviet evasion it is necessary to measure So testing against the present and expanded The losing the effective ness of various assumed provide some guide to the likelihood of detect in the event the does not complete its testing program or to test relevant to for missile the development of a or other It is Present possible that a moratorium agreement might go into effect without providing sufficient time to put into place any additional detection equipment in or adjacent to the and therefore that it might be necessary in an initial period to rely upon substantially the Considering the of this system as defined the might be able to avoid detection and of the fission we estimate that it in order to develop certain air defense and to achieve more client use of fashionable If the So should decide to conduct in the medium or high these would have to be in unique environs in order to avoid If con educated at extremely high they might be particularly difficult to slightly but these would still not provide consistent detection of the of noted in the preceding Effect of limited inspection within the The Soviet have their willingness to accept international con tool within the on a reciprocal The effectiveness of inspection within the would largely depend upon the ex tent to which these control could gain access to of suspected activity and upon the extent to which they were by other detection It would be possible for the by mobility or access to

that the accepted a substantial number of properly within the and that these could be and staffed in it would be to get at least percent reliability on fission in conventional as low as one in the detection system as a not this expanded system could consistently detect and identify deep under ground or or possibly sizeable at in excess of Thus the even in this maximum carry out some with a good chance of International manning of the In the effectiveness of any form of system for the purpose of evidence convincing to other na it is important to note that manning of the system as a practical greatly assist in meeting this For if the col election were in opera international participation in the Effect of peripheral expansion of monitor If additional were ing established around the periphery of the the range of Soviet maneuverability would be Since such a comprehensive system would take from to following Its approval to reach maximum it is questionable whether It could play a a SECRET current and analysis of radioactive debris would add substantially to the of convincing a Up and a majority of Up in at tempting to prove the nuclear origin of those of not likely to produce international manning of detection would assist in pressure on the to produce an explanation of underground by seismic Soviet estimate of the risk of The Soviet probably have a fairly accurate estimate of the present of the Up detection and they would therefore be able to project the effect of ex padding Up in the ways They are probably aware that our de section even under maximum con could not detect all of nuclear or advice proof that all were They would also recognize that certain of would be virtually certain of They could probably estimate the and environmental within which there would be a reasonable chance of detection under of they never be certain of the of the Up detection They would realize that new for detection or in about which they were were always there would be some uncertainty in Soviet calculate of their ability to escape detection and proof of their PROBABLE SOVIET POLICY We believe if the to a moratorium on nuclear its policy in initially will be to abide by the of the We believe this because the So not only would not wish to receive the opprobrium which would follow a viola but because they probably would hope that the effect of the moratorium would give them political and strategic ing the early days of the moratorium they probably would not be seriously to deviate from this in the light of our judgment between now and they have sufficient time to complete the they probably feel essential and they would recognize at the outset that there was a substantial category of which they could not conduct without a high risk of contrary to our the had to complete their essential test and had also to obtain postponement of the agreed then the would confront a grave choice be teen urgent military needs and the political of getting caught in We conclude that the Soviet decision would probably be substantially by the likelihood of getting and that the would not conduct in the cate where there would be a substantial chance that the world at large would conclude that they had broken the Some of the to complete the program could probably be in the category or in unique where the of detection and evidence were and the might conceivably decide to evade the moratorium to the extent of a very small number of of these our present judgment is that the possibility is slight that the will not complete its essential testing program prior the be to winning of the moratorium should antidote the completion of the we believe it unlikely that the would evade the pro except by ways they considered un likely to be We wholly exclude the possibility that they would take some As the period of the moratorium the military for might particularly if the Soviet had and if would provide much satisfactorily more effective and economical such as those for an This and other foreseeable testing needs might be con ordered by the so substantial as to argue against Soviet acceptance of an unit interrupted continuation of we believe that the would not estimate these needs as so urgent as to compel testing any substantial free of risk within the We conclude that the Soviet would almost certainly regard the political cone of getting caught as un except in extraordinary circus Apart from failure to complete their test in which the Soviet would consider detection through some now unforeseen there were a clear opportunity to gain a great advantage over the Up in nuclear or if the West had an enormous military advantage over the as a consequence of in Western military technology and If such did we believe the Soviet would quite possibly not observe the moratorium since they would probably feel that the military to be by testing would outweigh any ad verse political They would probably attempt to minimize the political of

be by some opposition to Radar on the part of the middle level who were associated with the many of whom appear to be of the reconstructed Al though the recent resignation of Radar from the

political line led to disaffection among party intellect talk and among the youth the tough ending of economic policy is to have dimension at the very highest In five of the nine apparently are opposed to comic program because of its effect on popular Such probably seek a modification of that program rather than Should the step in to this we believe that it would almost certainly maintain its support of although it in the decide to compromise some of the The immediate effects on popular morale of this hardening of the line will probably in a growth of tension and a higher flow of to West unless by the new We believe that the of local and sporadic and dis turbines will increase along with mounting But an East German revolt is un in view of the continued presence of Soviet and general public awareness that a resort to violence would prove as it did in or in East itself in From a Soviet point of via is probably the most successful and communist state in Eastern The though plagued by such as in raw mate and is probably the in Eastern and received Soviet aid in recent The standard of living which never as low a point as else where in the Bloc risen perceptibly over the past few The regime by and large been unruffled by the scene since the death of extreme in policy have generally been Thus the mary of Soviet policy are closer to accomplishment in than in any other The van Party voluntarily acknowledge their realty to the yet these head a party which is probably and more than that of any other Fictional do not jeopardize party efficacy and the top leadership With the election of party leader as effective power been concern in the of a doctrinaire leader unreservedly loyal to the a man singled out for special praise by There was a period of some fervent in

parent regime desire to identify itself with of We believe that in the regime is to gain notably greater this would be accomplished slowly and cautiously and under security and political repression

though probe by one of Eastern in ers of faithful and capable is firm ly in is by the presence of Soviet and is probably united behind party leader and The two most backward of the and are and the most Soviet sized in Eastern Party especially in have been less affected by than those of the other This is probably a reflection of the local reluctance or inability to adjust easily to new coupled with specific economic and political which argue for a continuation of a tough party geographical isolation from the rest of the Bloc and its antagonism toward are probably also in part responsible for the zeal in a rigid policy at home and realty to common border with three potentially hostile pro able to reinforce the conserve and interest in close with Popular discontent in both re mains Much of it is by the low of living in a high rate of But repressive regime have dissident in check and will probably continue to do barring an unlikely of internal As for party it probably does not

slave element may have previous if it is too weak to exercise meaningful influence under circus Although there may be some per sonnet in the leadership of the two are few for notable in THE OUTLOOK In THE Stability We believe that the relative stability now in Eastern will probably be over the next few the short term at both the and the Satellite the Polish are likely to follow an essentially conserve time internal further political and the general of the relatively flexible economic By and large this approach will probably enable the Satellite to maintain their authority and to restrain overt of dis we therefore do not expect a revival of those which led to the major upheaval of As for Soviet hegemony in we believe that the basic identity of between the and its Satellite their dependence on Soviet aid and and the overwhelming military together with its willingness to use force if will maintain the essential solid of the Bloc over at least the next five is the only Satellite which might be in a position to attempt to become another and for we have already we do not believe this Authority S Hail t But however successful the and its have been in at least they are still far from limit rating those in Eastern which the unrest of These still exist beneath the and are mani fest in discontent over current within the particularly at middle and lower intellectual and student agitation for liberal reform and national popular hostility to the in a led by party and intellectual and economic common to all who do not enjoy privileged A period of political turbulence might again emerge if internal were or there were economic or of the or local The for serious unrest currently appear to exist in and East though even here a popular we continue to as we in IE that ability to maintain its present will be key factor affecting the future political in Eastern The less or failure of the regime will greatly influence the future role of the nation which exist in most of the though now We do not now foresee leading to a coup in any other but if the Polish experiment is successful and acquiescence in it nationalist in more orthodox may be to seek greater The continued existence of as a communist country independent of will also tend to encourage nationalist in the to seek greater auto To the extent that the slave the contradict between Soviet acceptance of the slave status and Soviet policy toward the north do will further stimulate such If should emerge in the while to sought greater they would pro able receive such encouragement and support from as he could be out seriously Any move in the which was must or so strongly nationalist as to invite Soviet armed repression would almost certain ly not have Indeed in such a case he would probably line up with In while we anticipate that the ability in will we also anticipate an atmosphere of change and more highly than under Popular party intellectual and chronic economic appear to be pro These create very real within the combined with and to possible future Soviet and growing with the will continue to stimulate for reform and The extent to which these are very largely on Soviet Future Soviet Policy We perceive a ability on the part of to exercise unilateral author in the Communist The necessity of at least outward unity in the Bloc and the international must movement led the to promise on some and at least to con Side the of other Communist on Soviet policy in some to be internally Soviet for Satellite conformity and loyalty have been offset somewhat by the Soviet practice of the re in and of the more relaxed and flexible of This factor to increase son among the Satellite and keep nationalist fervent Under these the Soviet Un ion will probably encounter trouble in its to handle the complex associated with its presence in Eastern We be live that these are in and that the relatively sterile ist approach to Eastern come to an For the short term at while SECRET Authority E of and are still the security of the position in the will remain uppermost in So and to insure it given first Thus for the next few will almost certainly remain generally cautious in its going slow in the liberalization of its Satellite especially in the economic field But the Soviet do not seem to view a return to as either say or they may even regard it as despite the recent back on the Soviet policy during most of the turns which have since further serious to Soviet he such a relatively flexible policy will probably be The Soviet probably remain prepared to tolerate certain among the especially in internal economic and social and to tailor their policy to meet Satellite so long as Soviet hegemony and basic Communist are not into The will continue to place major reliance on indirect of to let the Satellite deal with their own internal unless these get out of An indication of the pragmatic nature of current Soviet policy is the reluctant acceptance of the which to be a adjustment rather than a temporary Tenderness in based since in part because the regime restrained and popular and removed the mediate threat to the Con direct Soviet press on Polish have based and with drawn its open support of the faction in the Polish The is still giving substantial economic aid to and is to equip the Polish Should the situation in appear to be getting out of the Soviet retain a large arsenal of and military with which to exert pressure on the regime or even to destroy although they cannot be certain that will always prove effective or that their use would In should remain in a state of and and Soviet control over the other not be might gradually allow a more independent role to other within the by the desire to maintain Soviet and his apparently believe that if some are gradually and ludicrous ly in the will the domestic prestige of the will be and eventually the Satellite will become to a close real township with the probably at least considered the feasibility of gradually evolution toward a group of semi independent Communist allied to We doubt that the have as yet made up their on any such especially after and but they may come to believe that some such evolution would reduce the of serious Satellite improve for comic and enhance the reputation of the in On the other should essential So control over the area appear to be threat end or should move notably farther away from in for a reversion to a policy would al most certainly In the event of a lite revolt beyond the capacity of the local regime to suppress or a Satellite attempt to secede from the socialist the Soviet would almost certainly intervene mile in would probably lead to the conclusion that the Satellite in general were a failure and that a return to more repressive the best of coping with the in Eastern Soviet reaction to another Satellite party like that in at greater autonomy rather than outright secession would be largely dependent on the particular for ex of the intervention to the Authority in a major military the So would probably again attempt to make the best of a bad but tolerance situation use indirect to regain control on the or to limit the extent of there to be few outside and little chance of sustained local the Soviet might do not that the be with such a choice during the next few a recurrence of the coal which permitted the Polish is highly None of the other Satellite now to have either the inclination or the to declare its The concern over its position in Eastern and its resultant sensitivity toward potentially disruptive West em influence in this area probably contribute significantly to the recent Soviet to obtain some form of ratification of the status already if concerned about Up aid to probably that the West may be able to exert con miserable influence toward encouraging great er independence on the part of Satellite The presumably believe that t Up acquiescence in the status quo in Eastern would tend to undermine Sat elite of future Up support and thus reduce the likelihood of or Despite various Soviet as to the stability of mutual troop reduce we believe that the will continue to maintain sizeable in Eastern The recently that an Soviet Will be withdrawn from East In as well as from of an it will almost certainly retain a sizeable garrison in East A major reduction would not only threaten its hold on this key Satellite major of but would have in and ultimately the whole Sat elite Indeed the presence of Soviet in East is probably by as a desirable form of implicit on the and Satellite Economic Outlook Unsatisfactory will remain a factor to popular and in the over the next few The progress of the various Satellite in economic distress for the most been slow and is unlikely to accelerate very Some modest improvement in economic cond will probably take but we estimate that gains in living will on the whole be smaller than those of the past several We also anticipate of industrial growth similar to those of the period but materially lower than those during in both output is probably still below revolution and these in were at the point since the of Communist Under these the will probably have to provide further and of badly such as and raw to bolster the Satellite and some what improve living In addition the will probably fur increase their to ra finalize the Bloc economic structure on the basis of an division of both bilateral through joint economic and multilateral consultation through the Council for Economic Mutual As The stated objective is now the long range of comic for this pro

integration The program will also continue to be plagued by Bloc of certain key raw and cultural and by the legacy of past emphasis on industrial in each Because of their economic we expect further by the to in crease trade with Such trade Authority generally grown considerably since in both absolute and relative by it had percent of Satellite trade turnover to percent in But there already been a slow down in the growth of trade with the in part by the expansion of credit and trade This trend will probably In the case of a drop in the world market of its chief coupled with the availability of substantial Bloc is likely to have similar unless offset by from the trade will also be severely limited by chronic among the of Western and of readily portable common Trade and extension of to in particular by and East have been en courage by the to support its political offensive in these While this trade is mutually profitable in many it is built in part upon which the except for may be hard to The under written these in some IMPACT Of WESTERN The ability to influence the course of Satellite development through and directed toward the Sat themselves is the in Soviet policy since the death of and the fervent and confusion in the which have a which is probably more open to Western influence than at any time since Despite the present trend toward stabilization of the Satellite we foresee a continuation of and within the various Sat together with the trend toward expanded the continued existence of a and possible renewal of the trend toward greater In the impact of Western we have not considered the use of force or an Western policy of encouraging and of supporting them if they Satellite provide poor for Western influence in Eastern Eu despite still strong nation list among the Satellite the majority of whom are probably list and in their West ability to give outside stimulus to popular dissident or to provide a focus for is generally far less than must to counter such As for the of the their broad identity of interest with the and general subservience to it make them resistant to Western particularly as they the West as basically hostile to their own In the last the West cannot expect by its own to bring about the emergence of more autonomous in Eastern In the two on record and the in sought on their own initiative to free themselves from Soviet But if more of such should real for Western influence would be Aside from the influence of specific West en or such as the Satellite assessment of the general posture of the West and its relative strength have a though impact on Eastern These shape the popular and even the party conception of Up Soviet strength and of the consequent ability of either side to carry out its For a lack of unity within the Western alliance or to Western policy in other of the world may be as of a real time weakening of the Western Soviet scientific and technological press popular since they tend to undermine confidence in the that the West is both and more Economic Expanded Western trade with or economic aid to the to lessen their comic on the In two actual Western trade aid gave psychology cal as well as material

to low the Polish Greater Western trade with the orthodox or possibly some form of aid to would have more unequivocal On the one hand it might help to convince defiant leadership of Up willingness to support them if they sought greater On the other hand it might merely lend added prestige to the orthodox leadership without encouraging any to increase their Whether or not the economic of the individual Satellite citizen as a result of expanded Western trade or aid would depend on the of the it is possible that such trade would merely enable an expansion of present for the development of heavy index So far the generally in greater Satellite economic with the but in expanding its own economic assistance to the it is apparent ly trying to counteract the of such The Soviet may not have fully resolved conflicting inclination on this the possible but at the same time by the notion that expanded Western trade or aid might help in Eastern We believe that in this field lie some of the potentially most though least for Western influence on Satellite Believing that Western knowledge and can be used profitable by the the and its Satellite have permitted some limited and personal

not crush any which the conviction would grow that the had permanently withdrawn and instability in the would greatly The resulting outcome would vary in different In time most lite would probably be forced to radio call change their character or might even be We continue to believe that the would make a similar estimate of the of troop and that this would be a major reason why they are highly unlikely to accept Although also highly an East West agreement on German reunification which was in as an abandonment of the East German Satellite would almost certainly have major throughout the

The a long established and highly pro gram for scientific data in all the earth the geophysical Such a program a multitude of during a long period and over wide We believe that a major cause for the

We do not know of any Soviet submarine or other military in the Antarctic area either in connection with the program or in While it is possible that the So will develop an interest in the Ant arctic

have ESTIMATE Scope and Intensity of Dissident and Resistance Dissident to be widespread in the in living and such relaxation of regime con as took place during the last three have except perhaps in the in sufficient to reduce substantially general dis Save in nationalist in Eastern are as strong as In addition to common various population harbor special such as those towards towards Communist labor and towards enforced ideological towards anti religious The scope and intensity of how widely from country to One of the most important in both peacetime and wartime resistance potent till is whether or not the regime is as the national rather than an alien Except among certain of its own national the Soviet regime in itself among its own population as a legitimate national But Communist in the Far East have made somewhat less progress in Eastern again excepting have almost In the divided the existence of a alternative element some attraction which to increase but this to be a major factor only in East and those this Other resistance potential arise from in national in historical in economic and in religious In the last few most Bloc have sought to reduce popular discontent and

insure to circumscribed the range of permission and to provide various of their physical As a organ sized active resistance is negligible in the Bloc at the present Resistance Potential in Peacetime During the next few of life probably will not improve sufficiently to reduce in most count of the This dissident will probably canine to be expressed in various of passive resist with regime economic other ways of So long the do to there is also be some continuation of those of active resistance open of intellect dual Which have the past few such manifest are likely of Eastern In Communist some by and ethnic are also may Bloc recognize that the of popular support and the exciting of initiative would re quite not only betterment but some degree of liberalization of they also recognize that such increase the difficulty of party unity and complete control over the Thus they will to popular only in those ES in which they regard it as relatively safety do But any relaxation of willed to give dissident to press their in in direct each may be and complicated by elsewhere in the Bloc and from the Free of the campaign and the in and Palm have throughout the in some to the point of various of

and foreign influx may lead policy between and or to dis These might evoke greater resistance This would tend to be directed towards the elimination of specific rather than to the overthrow of the since the latter course would seem highly un promising unless there were a serious prior weakening of party and For these we regard major out of active resistance as al though these cannot be in certain volatile in Eastern So radio local will probably but they will almost certainly be within the of security to The primarily the monopoly of physical force with an evident willingness to use and a near monopoly of of communication remain In the regime shown less reliance on these but a primary safeguard against violent resistance is the widespread to which the Catholic Church important that it would provoke Soviet as elsewhere in Eastern Soviet suppression of the revolt and the absence of Western assistance have under lined the futility of violent Empire of former Bloc na in lost effective contact with their and are little known to Bloc Virtually all of them have from internal and many have been by Communist Empire do not significantly contribute to resistance and with rare except their would not be to of power after Resistance Potential in Event of General War At the outset of a general patriotism would act to diminish sharply the resistance potential in most of the and to some extent in Communist though in the latter case this would depend more on the of the In the Far Eastern any increase in resistance potential probably would be only But in the satellite of Eastern as well as in certain minority of the and unit China the Basic western the outbreak of war would rekindle of liberation and immediately increase the resistance This potential probably would be highest in and East We that unless the tide of war ran sharply against the Bloc and its military and security were significantly weak resistance of a nature could be or at least confined to manageable While we conclude that resistance active probably would not be a major factor so long as the outcome of the main conflict re resistance activity probably could be especially in Eastern Eu in the form of intelligence collection and aid to Western personnel in escape and evasion and minor sab The level of such activity would vary because of in resist and also as a result of the amount of outside assistance available and the location of battle Only can be made concerning the impact on resistance activity of the use of nuclear Much would depend on such as the extent and locale of the the of the dam age the extent to which regime con were Among population suffering direct pro able would first be then concentrate their exclusively on of per In sufficiently distant from attack to be largely resist might increase as dissident found that Communist had been on the other they might con that nuclear were so decisive that extensive resistance was irrelevant or un outside the attack area but sufficiently close to be caught in the re salting chaos would be subject to all these It is possible in against selected might weaken the more than they resistance The question of responsibility for the in station general war probably would not substantially affect the will to resist the in the Bloc Nor would the nationality of be in the majority of to have great bearing upon the by resistance

Short of or of a fundamental change in the leadership of the Soviet such as an increase or decrease in East West or Ideological within the would have little effect on resistance Any deterioration in

They probably interpret the vigor with which long the Up is now pressing this program as an effort to offset Soviet capable during the before become available in They probably also see in it an effort to bolster the of in order to reduce within some mean for accommodation or toward they probably look upon the pro gram as that the Up to continue to refuse disarmament on Soviet and is its to deal

major shift in Soviet They will be mindful in this connection of their own present de torrent if our of their progress are they will calculate that their own capable will have considerable pro by the time a substantial threat to them They are un likely to conclude that the Up would sub frequently pursue more aggressive of action or initiate general More they will reckon even if the assumed deployment did not a similar threat would later develop from and In the light of this and because of continued Soviet respect for Up deterrent we be live that the would not attempt to prevent by such

for the Up and its allies to determine whether or not they were meant to indicate an intention to resort to They will also try to capitalize on the view expressed in Eu rope and elsewhere that the

deeply grained suspicion that the West is as yet interested in arms limit only on a basis advantageous to it their basic aversion to inspect especially within their own from and their probable belief that the can still gain considerably by propaganda and unilateral at minimum real cost to Hence we doubt that the Soviet leader ship yet at any hard and fast position on disarmament The Kremlin is now actively seeking negotiate on a nuclear test a zone in Central and troop in which it as verisimilitude to its disarmament further pressure on the Western and c Authority SECRET other tangible We

corresponding willingness to pay a higher price for than their basic view of Western hostility will simple the Soviet to retain at least sufficient military rent power to meet what they regard as their minimum security Further we believe that will enter any disarmament agreement with the intent at the same time to seek con instantly to enhance its military capable and to achieve an eventual military superiority over the But if the deterrent power is and the Soviet will almost certainly become more concerned over the prospective piling up of advanced nuclear with the of war by fiscal If

belief that less agree behavior would be likely to un determine free world unity and resistance to Soviet a growing confidence that the Soviet Union will ultimately its principal the without to and a belief that in a situation of generally tension significant comic could be from purely military to other important Reducing the of Nuclear War There is little doubt as to the serious con corn with which the generation of Soviet have come to view the cone of a nuclear Though assertion in March that another world war would mean end of world civilian just the collapse of was recent by the Soviet suggest that they are well aware that widespread mutual devastation would The shift in emphasis from expansion by local aggression to peaceful existence tactics probably at least in part this concern over the of nuclear An important element in the Soviet desire to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war is the apparently growing confidence of the present Soviet that the will within a finite period outstrip the Up in a competition for influence and This confidence upon the rapid growth of So power and of Soviet influence and upon in the of once and It is further by the doctrine that Communist victory is his typically inevitable and by the Soviet belief that they have the will and capacity to realize this This present mood of dance them all the more reluctant to see this prospect by the one de development which could spell immediate dis thermonuclear At the same time we do not mean to sup best that Soviet conduct is shaped by an over riding fear that nuclear war is On the the Soviet probably believe that the West is not disposed to undertake such a and that even if it their own nuclear have already become such that the Western are highly unlikely to take the risk for any but the They are probably also reasonably confident that they can conduct their own policy in such a way as to limit the they must be disturbed over the possibility of war by per out of local or even by Among other they are con that the West would use nuclear weak ons in local with the resultant danger of expanded Perhaps for this rea son Soviet deny any dis function between the of tactical and strategic use of nuclear and as sert that any use of nuclear in a limited war is bound to broaden the These may or may not represent the true Soviet in either case they are probably designed to inhibit us from such use of nuclear The Soviet are probably also con that the of advanced delivery and the consequent pressure for an ever higher state of readiness on both will increase the danger of accident or

desperate Western effort to reverse tide of by the Hence we see such security as being an important factor underlying the Soviet attitude toward The probably consider because of mounting anxiety over the of nuclear and the resultant sure for the disarmament issue valuable for reducing the likelihood of nuclear above all by the use of Western and by helping to induce their withdrawal from around

thus reduce the effectiveness and cohesion of Western resistance to Soviet it is likely that cow that some sort of regional disarmament measure would initiate a course of leading toward dissolution of and the exclusion of Up military power from the continent of through the political as well as the directly military effects of a disarmament agreement the Soviet lead ers might expect to improve their position and to increase their freedom of maneuver the Soviet View of the Military Balance of Power Another key factor in the Soviet attitude is their view of the potential effect disarm on the balance of military power between the Bloc and the The could calculate that the elimination of nuclear on both sides would be greatly to their being confident that they would a preponderance in

consumer goods expansion and a vila for foreign trade and IE The Soviet Atomic Pro R the Soviet in view of their numerous other for economic cannot but be concerned over the growing cost and complexity of In this respect they face the same as do their in the if the believe their own doctrine that the capitalist of the Western are artificially buried up by pro they may believe that arms reduction could the ultimate economic collapse of the capitalist at the same time as it in Communist economic We do not believe that there are any spelling domestic political under ing the Soviet on While the Soviet people undoubtedly share the fear of nuclear public opinion on this issue can hardly be considered a major operative force on leadership anti Of more significance may be divergent within the leadership to which we shall refer The Fourth Country Problem Although we believe that the are concerned over the Fourth Country we do not consider that it a major role in Soviet except insofar as West and possibly Communist China are The repeated of Soviet over revival of a Ger man threat lead us to give much credence to their expressed concern over nuclear the problem of must China is not as we mate that Soviet failure to date to provide their with nuclear probably some fear lest this develop increase the likelihood of ad with all the Aside from these the have shown far less concern over the that fourth count possessing nuclear might trip ger off a nuclear war than over the in here in the nuclear Indeed we suspect that their of or a discussion of the see the forthcoming IE Development of Nuclear by Fourth interest in this issue are based at least in on their belief that we ourselves are much RESTRAINING In THE In several powerful motive underline the increasing stress on disarmament over the last few But several other remain to be assessed before we can address ourselves to the key how far do the desire to go in reaching agreement on specific disarm as opposed unilateral and propaganda exploitation of the what as well as do they see in such agreed final what price are they willing to Among these are the caution of the their acute fear of weakening the So power their strong suspicion of the their aversion to and their probable belief that they can still gain considerably by propaganda and unilateral at little cost to all of which add to the difficulty of reaching agree on any basis acceptable to the so recently what they probably regard as a substantial nuclear the are almost certainly highly reluctant to risk compromising it by moving too far too fast in an tried all highly spec native We believe that they are feeling their way in an area where the ultimate of are highly Powerfully this attitude of caution is a deeply grained suspicion of the disarmament position taken by the himself that our pro are designed to enhance our own mile try position while weakening that of the In the Soviet leadership patently does not believe that we are inter tested in reaching on arms limit on the basis of what they believe to be the actual balance of In of they simply do not view the of our in the same light as we In some they have partially accepted our they claim Authority that our subsequent withdrawal of them a lack of serious Closely related to the above two is a probable Soviet belief that the West would interpret any of Soviet willingness to compromise as acting overeagerness to reach agreement and would press for further from the One of the most important to agreement is the basic aversion to ex tensile inspection within its We do not believe that an intention to evade the of an agreement is the chief reason for Soviet aversion to although this motive cannot be Rather we regard the chief to be their genuine fear of their deeply grained security con and their conviction that secrecy is an Since they probably regard them as far better informed on our military situation than we are on they must look upon many of inspection as bene fitting us far more than This is sup tested by their renunciation of our inspection as gigantic intelligence gathering In they have as to the effectiveness of inspection price in assuring that are be the Soviet ing probably also fear the disturbing effects on a tightly society which might result from the presence of foreign within the the always expressed willingness to consider certain of ground although ar which would minimize With the We that their sensitivity on this issue might diminish somewhat with We for the Soviet flexibility on tourist travel and the opening of hitherto closed to foreign more open and the These in the wind suggest at least that Soviet fear of ideological contamination is and that their fear of see their poverty is giving way to pride in showing off their The prospective of reconnaissance may also cause reconsideration of Soviet on Another restraining factor in the Soviet conduct of is their probable view that they can still gain considerably by prop agenda and other of at little cost to Underlying this is their belief that over a period of time Western pub opinion may force at least some Western to cut back their military stab as well as to soften their on arms without corresponding Soviet They probably also ex pet that further exploitable fissure will de below among the Western THE SOVIET POSITION Of DISARMAMENT We doubt that the Soviet in balancing off the various as yet at any hard and fast position on the disarmament Indeed we would be if there were not certain in point of view among the top leadership In this it is difficult to separate the disarmament issue from the general strategy of of which Soviet dis armament policy an integral More doctrinaire may fear that this entire approach endanger the maintenance of revolutionary plan and the fabric of Soviet control in the is ultimately in compatible with the degree of tension and vigilance to justify the in the These pro able most of the may be particularly of the to be derived from disarmament and fearful of the which inspection would To date Soviet disarmament policy dominated by such an attitude of by acute suspicion of Western and by the feeling that the vulnerability of the West position can continue to be at minimum cost to the The principal tactics involved are broadly those of though ostensibly and in some actual willingness to negotiate is also See the forthcoming IE of Certain Up Satellite These tactics are by the vagueness and superficial attractiveness of So most of which seem designed more for propaganda than to lead to We are also struck by the which seem designed as much to create on the West through as to lead to As to the probably believe that the West is not yet ready to to arms on any basis which equitable to the They see the Up as not yet itself to the enhanced power which the insist must be For their own believing that time is working in their they may see in semi on broad disarmament is as distinguished from essentially mar final like test until their position is further especially through the of a substantial they may expect that the Western position will be further eroded by this on certain limited the Kremlin is actively seeking to conclude agree in order to lend verisimilitude to its po and place further pressure on the West em among other more specific In this category we place a nuclear test a zone in and in trial all of which discuss in detail in the the pear willing to pay a certain price for these in all three for they are probably willing to accept some de free of While this may be as far as the is currently willing to go in actual arms it does not necessarily sent the ultimate extent of Soviet willingness to negotiate particularly as time goes We regard the disarmament J policy still in a view by the flexibility shown since The most recent are the announce of nuclear test suspension and its illness to open technical on a test Even complaint about while clearly by propaganda is probably ship somatic of its growing concern over the of nuclear although its handling of this particular issue did not suggest sufficient uneasiness to simple the to enter mean mindful on Of a great deal will depend on how much the can by its present tactics in a largely unit real weakening of the To the extent that these tactics tend to inhibit the use and deployment of nuclear and to create strong for Up and provided the do not become more con over the of cow may see little gain in its position on except in a tactical But if the deterrent power is main and and the see only minimal of unilaterally weakening there may be some further change in the Soviet As time the various already may exert greater influence to this The So will almost certainly become more concerned over the prospective continued ing up of advanced nuclear with the of war by They will almost certainly become in increasingly disturbed over Up deploy the of the and Up acquisition of first and then second genera If at the same time they remain confident that they can achieve their by the desirability of the likelihood of general war by disarmament may loom in their In fact they would probably look upon progress toward certain disarmament as the peaceful strategy For these the might become willing to pay a higher price to obtain disarmament than they have heretofore been willing to pay or perhaps by fear the West is We see two independent which could contribute to eventual Soviet willingness to negotiate as a sign of willingness to reach disarmament We can also expect the traditional hard Soviet great reluctance the may come around more to to show their hand prior to much of the point of view that the West is really our At the same there is a good interested in some arms on which would be as equitable by the chance of further dramatic unilateral as we have already particularly while is at the there might be some domination in traditional aversion to the presence of foreign on Soviet Thus we see some possibility of a grow ing Soviet in expanding the area of serious disarmament with the We cannot predict when or on what this might By and large we ex pet that Soviet caution and suspicion on such will die if at and that any change will be We also foresee a variety of which might cause Soviet policy to move back and forth from time to For such might be forced by among the So by in the by reversion to a tough line for internal In any we can estimate with some confidence the beyond in the foreseeable Soviet policy will not They will be very careful not to give more than they They will not allow ex kept within which are carefully circus and most the basic Soviet view of Western hostility will simple the Soviet to retain at least sufficient try deterrent power to meet what they re as their minimum security In we believe that the will enter any disarmament agreement with the intent at the same time to seek constantly to enhance its military and to achieve an eventual military superiority over the Authority APPENDIX SOVIET VIEW Of DISARMAMENT ISSUE Control and Limitation of Mass Destruction The almost certainly regard West nuclear strength as the chief threat to their security and as a major obstacle to achievement of their external Thus to them the key disarmament problem is by nuclear Aside from level their own nuclear the seeking to meet this problem by an in tensile propaganda campaign and a series of disarmament both designed to keep the nuclear issue in the forefront of The goal is to create a climate of concern over the by nuclear to underline the initiative in seeking to do something about this pro and to inhibit the use of such by the Cessation of Nuclear The recently suspension of nuclear is intended to focus pressure on the West for a similar as part of its broad cam pain to stigmatiZe nuclear and in habit their Widespread over the effect of continued and growing Western popular to stop testing made this issue readily The mixed this pressure by timing their announce to precede a long Up test the timing was also to follow their own intensive test While the have left themselves free to resume testing at any we believe that they are actually seeking an agreed test mora thorium with minimum Their desire to put pressure on the Up to accept cessation on these largely for the un lateral nature of their They probably expect that the Up and the will now be to negotiate a Al though their test program is not yet as far advanced as ours technical exist for further they probably felt that their present test had them in a sufficiently good military posture that the need for testing was out weighed by the positive was probably moth by a desire to impede future Up testing of missile one for the this ad vantage would outweigh gains from their own future A desire to forestall nuclear development pro able also some agreed in principle to but there are numerous that it will seek to minimize the need for We believe that the would accept a small number of fixed inspection perhaps with some provision for limited mobility of inspect By the ease with which a test ban can be it is seeking to create the impression that this limited will suffice to detect and thereby to undercut any Western insistence on more elaborate If the West were to insist on a more elaborate the lin would probably condemn this as demon starting lack of good faith and as an in It would probably rupture on this rating that the blame for the deadlock would attach primarily to the Assuming an agreed test the would be unlikely to attempt to evade at least for some With the complex of their recent intensive test they be reasonably satisfied with the position they have they would to balance the of detection against the obvious value they have seen in a test We have already that the Soviet would almost certainly regard the political of getting caught red handed as except in such ex extraordinary as a clear unity to gain a great advantage over the Up if the Up had a clear ad vantage over the In such we re renunciation of the test ban as more likely than Ban on Use of Nuclear The long standing Soviet campaign to obtain a ban on use of nuclear as a de offensive ploy to counter the Up monopoly and later great superiority in such The theme is still being actively employed by the and probably would be even harder following agreement on a test suspend it must be clear to them that Western agreement to the use of nuclear almost certainly cannot be in any the may press for a more limited agreement or even unilateral that nuclear not be used but if at in re aviation for an prior use of nuclear The strongly condemned any to distinguish between the con of and em employment of nuclear primarily be cause they want to inhibit us from concluding that we can be free to use nuclear in less than total This stand does not the from later such in as they in tend it leaves their reaction in Nuclear Production Cessation and Reduce of A key question in ing Soviet on production of sizable for and on reducing is their view of what nuclear While we cannot ascertain the Soviet estimate of their stockpile we know that they are expanding their fashionable It is true that certain made by in March his belief that the were and may have already sufficiency in nu clear more re gently he that this judgment lied only to Although the negotiate on cessation of material pro we do not believe that it would either unilaterally cease such production or agree to mutual cessation until its minimum stockpile had been the Soviet view as to how much inspection should be permitted under any agreement would al most certainly be far less extensive than our Evasion might depend in part upon their knowledge of our intelligence pro auction but the would pro able consider it unnecessary to run the risk of detection if they had already assured their minimum The might agree to mutual reduce of stockpile so long as their relative power position the Up was at no stage by of their own stockpile below a minimum deterrent Control of Other of Mass De The consistently treat these weak as distinguished from nuclear explosive as of mass which should be along with nuclear they appear to regard the problem as much less important than that of nuclear explosive Control over Advanced Delivery IE Feasibility and Likelihood of Soviet Evasion of a Nuclear Test made clear that the the Up on control of outer space as an attempt to limit the advantage in the field of rocket and to preserve the geographic advantage which its peripheral base structure to the Hence he by that control of outer space withdrawal from overseas bases must be closely In Soviet their achievement of an capability will greatly enhance their military position the Up by drastically reduce ing the Up geographical So long as even a substantial portion of Up striking power is dependent on overseas we be live that the will insist on linking the two In the more distant when the mary strategic strike of both sides have become truly intercontinental in the Soviet calculation of the relative van and of agreed and inspection might tend to An additional factor would be the of miscalculation in in the almost instantaneous readiness of second generation we are almost certain that they would still insist on considering all of strategic striking power air craft and naval as well as Even in this the problem of supervision would remain a powerful inhibitory factor in Soviet They would recognize that an extremely elaborate inspection apparatus would be on a the development of reconnaissance might affect their view of this Prevention of Surprise Attack by Inspection For a period in Soviet to indicate a mounting awareness of Soviet vulnerability to surprise which may explain the inclusion in the Soviet pro of May of a ground warning system for this The subject been included in most subsequent Soviet disarm and Summit conference but always in quite vague It may be that the have included this item to give an appearance of receptivity in view of the Up interest in They probably consider that they have less need for than the because of the openness of Western society and the political upon Western ability to launch a surprise at nevertheless we believe they are also somewhat The have obviously our on various of inspection in the Arctic as designed to maximize our own Similarly their own proposal for an inspection zone on each side of the in designed to maximize their We are unable to say what tie would regard as equitable zonal but we believe that there may be some flexibility in their position on this another obstacle to Soviet acceptance of various inspection early any Soviet in their aversion to which we have previously Beyond they do not seem persuaded of the efficacy of inspect in strategic Soviet have in re cent their view that even the most complex inspection system could because of the vast and great variety of rule out or give warning of an attack deliberately and secretly the probably view adequate as an extreme ly elaborate inspection one even then of doubtful and one which by its very nature would most completely expose them to Western and there may be a gradual shift in the Soviet attitude toward to vent surprise particularly if their con corn over the of war by miscalculation It is perhaps significant that the already appear prepared to accept a greater degree of inspection in Eastern connection with their disengagement pro than in the But at best we believe that their initial approach to any in section scheme would be and ex extremely and confined to an area where they felt they would be only minimally SECRET on and Conventional Arms At least in their the have shown themselves rather flexible and conventional force They are doubtless aware of the much greater combat force which they have shown themselves able to field from an agent force Of the various force of or million they have favored the lower limit probably in order to induce a maximum reduction of Western strength in forward abandon of some overseas and also to gain the maximum from and cost for domestic economic expansion and aid and trade We believe that would probably consider seriously an offer of considerable if it were not tied to political and other and if only modest were on conventional arms have not been in Soviet or prop panda for some although made occasional to their desirable The probably feel that the West more to gain than they from such reduce The frequently for a freeze on or a percentage reduction in arms probably largely for propaganda rea By on Free World popular dis satisfaction with burdensome it may expect to add to the political of Western Here Soviet re reluctance to permit effective inspection would be a major The Kremlin would doubt less be reluctant to reveal the extent to which past have concealed military expand Disengagement The apparently see distinct ad vantage in certain of disengagement primarily in which would the retraction of Up power from this key They are prepared to pay some price for what probably regard as more than In this connection we regard their concern over the situation in Eastern and their resultant desire to minimize the of Western intervention in event of another Satellite as an important Beyond they are all too well aware of the potential impact on Western of the withdrawal of Up deterrent power or even the nuclear component the threat by a West undoubtedly heavily on Soviet and probably considerable impact on their desire to prevent West Ger man acquisition of nuclear arms and delivery particularly We do not believe the or ex acceptance of the plan for barring nuclear from Central While Polish were reportedly some what probably saw in the the proposal an additional lever for general ing opposition to the nuclear deterrent program and a useful gambit for Submit the scheme such from the Soviet standpoint that they would probably be prepared to simple it and to accept a good deal in the way of Among other would see in an agreed zone in Central a compelling precedent for Western acceptance of further along these We believe that a mutually agreed thin out of conventional in would hold considerable for the They would probably expect it to impair the shield without correspond singly weakening the Soviet to start a trend toward Up and to reduce the likelihood of Western intervention in any Satellite We that would agree to a mutual withdrawal of all Up and Soviet from foreign soil in despite the many in In our view the will retain a sufficient military presence in key of Eastern to minimize the of Sat elite and underline Soviet deter nomination to intervene in that as well as to maintain the military threat by their present forward position in Inspection would again be as undesirable under either of the above alter but the have shown willing ness to make in this Though regarding the presence of Western in the as a likely stimulus to dissident and as a factor in event of another probably that these can be sufficiently insulated from the local populace to make these

Authority Authority Authority for of the w AND WORLD To Up SE Of NUCLEAR In LIMITED In THE AR AST THE PROBLEM This estimate was by the as a result of a study prepared by the of State and Defense and the Joint of with appropriate participation of the Central Intelligence on Up and Allied for Limited Military to May Among the under which this study was prepared were that it did not examine Up and Allied against overtly employed Soviet armed nor against an enemy nu clear since the latter case was as overt employment of Soviet On the other it was assumed that the Up used nuclear select timely from the outset in four hypothetical Communist aggression in the Far This estimate whether or not the enemy would employ nuclear weak ons if the Up employed and the impact on world if either the Up or both sides employed It itself to the above in the four hypothetical given in the study where the Up em nuclear the outset in response to Communist aggression through North invasion of South Communist attack on Query and Communist attack on and North attack on South and It is based on the hypothetical which are in Appendices of the study and which are at the outset of of this We believe that if the Up used nuclear in meeting Bloc local aggression in the Far there would be a grave risk that the would retaliate Indeed any Far East Comma in list taking into account the posse ability of such Up would be unlikely to launch a local aggression without ing received of Soviet We estimate though the will be determined to a void of action gravely general war throughout the period it pro able that its growing military likewise increasingly deter the Up from taking such There the would probably estimate that local Communist use of nuclear I in direct and response to their use by the Up would not family lead to expansion of into general and they would under tain be prepared to use such or and we cannot exclude the possibility that the Comma would respond in possibly in nuclear against us bases in the area selected to minimize the add risk of general If the with nu clear they would attempt to do so in such a manner as to limit the of general The itself would probably prefer to avoid open involve and would probably provide the necessary to Communist China or North though retaining Soviet the would probably confine their use of nu clear within comparable to those by the The likelihood of Communist regalia with nuclear would be if the Up mounted nuclear at tack deep into Communist create ing a situation to which and ping would almost certainly feel to respond by on Up bases and nuclear capable in the Far in the case of Communist aggression against South or Tai wan the us nuclear response were lim item to or the the would probably respond in In the case of kind in the same local aggression against Query and or South the list response would be less If Up nuclear were confined to the immediate Query and or and the might attempt to win without nu clear or seek to break off the even if the Up nuclear response were limited to the immediate area of Query and Many Free World and would be and encore aged by the prompt Up resistance to Communist but the Up use of nuclear would arose wide spread fear of general war and would tend to obscure Communist responsibility for The Up would be widely condemned by popular especially in for the use of nuclear We believe that the adverse would the favorable effects in most The adverse reaction would be gated if the Up response quickly the fighting without causing large civil and respect for Up power would be Even the stigma resulting from the Up initiation of the use of nuclear would not be re On the other if the with and were and ex of general war would rise even and great pressure would be on the Up to reach a Deputy

on page Authority DISCUSSION THE GENERAL MILITARY ACTION Bearing on the Initial must Decision to Attack In our view the crucial determinant in any decision to initiate local agree or subsequently to respond in kind to Up use of nuclear in such would be the estimate of the resultant of general We con to estimate that respect for Up nuclear power will remain such that neither the So nor the are likely to pursue of action which in their judgment seriously risk general Largely for this we do not believe that any of the four hypothetical of Communist aggression considered in this estimate is likely to occur through continued from page The paper to recognize adequately the meaning of selective Up use of nuclear weak it to equate to geographical on target also to case target and accuracy of Given these to civilian appear Incompatible with the basic influence popular The paper certain qualitative judge as to the relative of adverse pop lar reaction and favorable popular reaction to Up nuclear these relative measure are largely Such also appear to fail to give due weight to many which would re in addition to the fact that the United employed nuclear Some of these additional would be the initial success by Up military the public state of Up governmental concerning Up and and the extent to which popular opinion clearly the military action as resulting from Communist There would certainly be both clause and to say that in most the book would drown out the as in the would Is to attempt a precision of not considered feasible for the hypothetical being We must for the of this that such aggression taken Several flow from this Most the would have this aggression only after careful calculation of the likelihood of Up intervention and of the resultant of general Both Up and the general posture of the Up in the Far East would almost certainly lead them to cal curate that Up intervention with nuclear would be the only immediately effect time Up The most likely un which the would decide to launch local aggression in the Far East would be that the that the Up would be deferred from even a local nuclear response were sufficient to justify taking the risk and that even if the Up did their own were sufficient both to cope with this reaction and to deter the Up from broad ending the conflict to general This substance might arise in the case of a sub spatial increase in Communist those of the especially in the Far as for example by the possible winning of nuclear and advanced de livery in Communist early in this the Bloc might estimate that the Up would be unwilling to accept the and the adverse Free World involved in with nuclear to Bloc and being unable to respond effectively in any other would choose not to do so at We believe it most likely that any must aggression in the Far East would be only in full consultation with since the North or North would almost certainly in list upon certain of Soviet support in event of Up retaliation beyond their to we cannot ex the possibility of unilateral action on the part of the based on their calculation that despite Soviet relic dance the would be to come I to their support if the Up with nuclear We regard such as un although possibly less so in the case of Query and In any regardless of their estimate of the likelihood of Up nuclear the almost certainly would have made and to meet this con If the decision to launch a local war had been taken well in might have already provided Keeping with some nuclear and perhaps advanced of both to deter a Up nuclear response and to counter it if it We believe that in any event the will press the for such and that the may introduce these into Communist China by although they will almost certainly remain under Soviet the might promise the to provide them quickly with such if would also probably attempt to deter the Up at the time of the aggression by in case the Up nuclear Bearing on the Subsequent Communist Reaction Once Communist local aggression in the Far East had been and the Up had locally with nuclear cow and Keeping would face a critical de Broadly their reaction might range from abrupt termination of the conflict or seeking through the fight with conventional to in kind with nuclear As already we believe the crucial determinant would be their estimate of the resultant of general and Keeping would be acute conscious that the of general war had materially The very fact of Up use of nuclear would reflect Up determination to accept some We that if they had initially the aggression rating a Up nuclear response and if they were confident of their capability to deal with it they would promptly react with nu clear on the other and ping had our they might be more disposed to seek a quick settle on the basis of the status quo ante rather than further increasing the risk of general war by a nuclear response of their Even in this case of initial the might regard their nuclear deterrent power as making Up resort to gen real war sufficiently unlikely that they could afford to take the risk of making a nuclear they would have power additional for a nuclear among of a Soviet threat end dire if the with nuclear they must save face by following the vulnerability of the Up bases in the Far on the So the importance of supporting their chief and the damage to the Soviet deterrent posture if the to The manner in which the Up employed nuclear could have a critical bearing on whether or not the made a nuclear If such use were highly and above all if confined to the mediate area of the might not respond with nuclear But especially if the Up nuclear deep into Communist Keeping would almost certainly appeal desperately for Soviet and we that the So would feel to come to the sup port of their chief They would probably calculate that they could not afford the loss to the Bloc and the blow to their own prestige and position of a crippling of Communist Chi nose The Communist reaction would also be conditioned by their appreciation of the gen real Up posture at the They would look to other Up military the degree of alert in the and Up for dance of whether the Up was to fight a local war if to ex and the or to accept a return to the status In this connection Up of the united nature of our if con sister with our military might have considerable Such might tend to reassure the that a neo termination of the conflict on an capable basis was On the other these might reassure them that their use of nuclear locally would not lead the Up to broaden the If it to the that the Up was not prepared to expand the con flint or to conduct a they would probably be more to continue the fighting nuclear If on the other hand the while limiting its initial nuclear nevertheless peaked determined to press on to and prepared to expand the conflict in the Far East if the Communist reaction would tend to be more They might still launch some nuclear to reduce Up strike in an attempt to achieve a but they would probably also move to secure an early end to the The of Nuclear Response In case the decided to react with nuclear if the Up had used such in the Far Keeping and really would nevertheless do so in such a manner as to limit the that would expand into general For this reason we believe that the would be oath to intervene directly through identifiable Soviet to attack Up bases and They would probably prefer early to provide the necessary and support to the or posse by the North We believe they would also calculate that the limited Up base struck true in the Far East would be highly runner able even to attack by Communist But the would provide extensive aid and extending possibly to They would almost certainly provide Soviet to participate in the air defense of Communist in event of widespread Up on Communist we cannot exclude the possibility of Soviet intervention in the Far Keeping and to limit the of general war also would probably lead them to confine their within to by the If Up use of these was confined to the immediate combat we believe that the would similarly limit their the possibility cannot be that even if Up use of these were to the immediate combat the might also launch nuclear against Up bases in the Western Pa civic selected so as to minimize the danger of general If the Up deep in Communist the enemy would pro able react by selected Up bases in the Western GENERAL WORLD Free World to a Up response with nuclear to Communist agree son in the Far East would vary Pro video that the aggression were clearly most of our and probably some neutral would be at least initially to view with approval our prompt and fortnight aid to the victim of How this feeling would be by fear that nuclear war in the Far East would spread into general Such apprehension would rise greatly if the Up nuclear counter attack were of such a for example deep Into Communist that it to be in excess of the force and particularly if the employed nuclear in re Even if the war were there would be fear that one side or the other might subsequently broaden These would lead to strong on the part of other to seek a prompt end to Along with Free World fear of expanding would be a widespread adverse reaction to Up use of nuclear Should these inflict large particularly among it would intent Up use of nu this clear led to a quick victory without large civilian this attitude of dance would tend to diminish and to be offset by confidence in Up deterrent The adverse reaction to Up use of nu clear would be particularly strong throughout most of Here such use would tend to be upon as white indifference to the of Indeed the of on might have enduring adverse con for the position in The reaction in Japan would be really in view of deep antagonism to the use of nuclear weak and Japan would probably not allow Up use of bases on its The adverse reaction might be to a limited ex tent if the in turn employed nu clear but the Up would still incur the podium of used them THE

almost certainly not hesitate to use in where milder tactics have Operation of certain such as the right of Catholic in the parliament to critic size will be continued only so long as such do not

sides appear to organize the need for the The regime will probably not return to brutal and will certainly seek to avoid any so intense as seriously to risk extensive popular It is also our conclusion that the regime will probably try to maintain its course toward a new political and comic Within the trend toward a strengthening of Party dominance and to ward at least exterior the regime will probably seek to be relatively moderate in its with the people and will continue to look for realistic rather than strictly doc to its economic The success of such an how is not as yet Even aside from

We believe that Polish to main tain a workable agreement with the and to steer clear of crises in that ship will continue in the foreseeable future to be one of the key There is a wide in the field of foreign in which the Polish Party would probably be if to defer to for the sake of Bloc join in or of which he would not otherwise He might also under certain circus diminish his friendly with the West if he that by so doing he could avoid his own power and the Polish independence of Soviet Although a Soviet demand that the give up Up aid unlikely in the near could make such a move at any We believe that the regime would probably give in to such a early if were willing to make up whatever the Polish economy would the regime would probably attempt to justify such an action by Up the regime could console itself by the contention that on this issue need not impair its internal independence The Polish regime would be most likely to stand up to Soviet if it felt that its own organizational

effective only if the resulting shift of economic orientation to the West were in limited by the threat of military There would be personal suffering and major dis in the economy in the event of a

assist the Chi nose to withdraw from the is it can agree to Nationalist at on the it can undertake to maintain resupply of Chicken by and Any of latter three of action eventually would probably involve Up on the and the Up could be before world opinion with expanding the scope of armed In this it is likely that the are willing to take considerable risk of major armed conflict with the If Up

addition to the continued interdiction of the might with little or no one or more of the smaller offshore This would be calculated to fall outside the scope of any Up to defense and would serve further the Communist objective of reading the Nationalist The effect would be further calculated as not prejudicial the Chi nose Communist position of as increasing the international sense of urgency

prolong the present crisis rather than bring it to the Such action might be related to the ambassadorial in or to in the General simply of the But we believe that such in the Communist inter would be only a temporary Another Communist course of though we consider it is that the will gradually call off the interdiction of the If they did it would be because they had or had been persuaded by the that the inherent in interdiction were too and that another opportunity should be at some future Finally we consider it though un that the will as salt one or more of the major offshore is We consider this unlikely in their it would be almost certain to in solve them in major with the it would diminish the political and prop panda advantage they now and it would probably be unnecessary because they

the power and time of the They believe that the opportunity to put the Up in the dock un of peace should be to the and that sup port for the Up would be far less than it was in the Middle East They

the risk of their involvement they will be aware that the Up may be led by Communist to engage must If such are but limited to conventional and confined to the area adjacent to the the would probably that the did not require direct military assistance and would provide and material assist they would almost certainly not intervene at least in an overt man a direct confrontation of Soviet and Up If

output of for use in more basic Assuming Up control on the export of strategic we believe the increase in trade would have little effect on Soviet military potent Soviet with or Communist China would not be significantly The Soviet probably believe that trade with the Up would strengthen their line of peaceful codex diminish Up ability to maintain Western trade and a general ly strong and create friction in the West as various found themselves in compete with the Up for Soviet We do not believe that these would occur to a significant Most non Communist would favorably view an increase in

increase in Up of certain specific from the might seriously damage the trade or the foreign exchange of particular Free World DISCUSSION INTRODUCTION The possibility of a substantial increase in trade was raised by letter to President June that the would buy industrial really for the production of synthetic and consumer and would sell to the Up in return basic man and chrome and possibly some machinery and equipment of To accelerate the expand son of he that the Up pro video long term commercial He also the conclusion of agree exchange of technical and an agreement to regulate economic between the two although generally in was probably in the first instance a propaganda Whether or not it was it would further the Soviet line of by wearing to respond positively to Up It that world trade be that Up interested in getting an obvious reference to the Up the impact of which been by the the fact that to trade in the the propaganda of the He is certainly aware industry would be that the Soviet Union does not have sufficiently attractive to the Up market to support trade at such a he must also be aware that there is only the most remote chance that the in present would extend large and long term to the we believe that the Soviet Union genuinely an increase in its trade with the a trade which in comprised to the Up of million and from the Up of only The Soviet effort to strengthen its industrial base and to increase the availability of con summer goods would be by technologically advanced machinery and equipment from the for the chemical and plastic The would thus avoid some of the of develop as pointed out to the Central Committee in May could save much time by plant from the and West If in they could obtain long term Up they could acquire the to increase production with a minimum initial drain on their own The Soviet almost certainly also be live that important political gains would flow from a substantial increase in Soviet trade with the In their it would be likely to strengthen the line of peaceful coexistence and to weaken the effectiveness of Up to maintain a strong must The Soviet probably believe that such a development would fur diminish the Up ability to maintain Western trade They may think trade with the Up would create divisive friction in the West as other Western industrial the Up increase ing its share of the Soviet POTENTIAL MAGNITUDE Of TRA Despite Soviet desire to expand it is difficult to estimate the extent to which this trade might realistically be ex to and to judge the parma hence of such an increase if it were to The primary involved would be the ability of the Soviet Union to make available for export which could be sold in the the willingness of the Up government to relax legal and administrative discriminate against trade with the and the willingness of private Up industry to do bus ness with the Soviet by the Soviet goods which we be live potentially available for export to the it is almost certain that the Soviet Union would have difficulty in increasing its ex change earning The Up now from virtually all its of the raw by for manganese and chrome in at one time major So to the Up of the new to which the Up turned have been by private and government and appear While the could undercut of these it would have to be wary of of which could result in additional Up While the Soviet would probably be willing to sell some of machinery in which they have made there would not be enough of such to yield a significant The would be unlikely to make the effort necessary to market ordinarily competitive of machinery and equipment in quantity to Up Up tending to restrict trade also pose a formidable beta to any increase in such Congress under which the import of and certain of Soviet origin is and tariff treatment is specifically the So thus it of the tariff bene since The lack of tariff treatment would be a most significant obstacle to Up of manganese ore and from the More it would hinder Up of Soviet goods which have not historically been part of trade but which probably have to enter the trade to finally a really sub spatial volume of Soviet The and other communist also place a high symbolic value on treat and would undoubtedly make it a major objective in any trade with the Up export continue to be more stringent than those recently agreed to by the of the Battle and prohibit governmental and date to the under legal Up or could grant no than commercial credit to the Soviet Even if the Up government to family tate trade with the the response of Up private industry is It would only depend in the first instance on the profitability of specific Even many Up importer would probably be reluctant to switch from established of especially in view of their uncertainty as to the permanent and reliability of the as a Many Up would be reluctant to give the access to equipment advanced that the would choose to compete in third country feeling that trade with the would be sporadic and might be reluctant to un undertake the retelling and plant modification to meet Soviet necessary private business often fore public in trade with the even though the transaction may a r If I W I a k be entirely and therefore would pro able move cautiously in the As to the permanent of Soviet desire for expanded trade with the Up and other ad performance sup that the fear of a or at least of highly irregular Soviet of is offer the Soviet desire to buy and technology rather than fin shed and it may be that in many the would proceed to produce their own and not draw further on the it likely that the West will continue to develop a variety of at active to the of Western ma would as a practical ease the pressure which growing internal develop and from other Bloc have on Soviet machinery and equip the aggregate of So demand for machinery and equipment should continue and even grow at a fairly steady while the still adhere basically to a doctrine of they have in fact this goal in virtually all key of the in of capacity for emergency and can thus afford to accept a degree of de sentence on the West in there may be a growth in Soviet willingness to buy finished from the In view of these conflicting it is clearly impossible to make any firm prediction of the extent to which Up trade with the realistically be to For the of this we believe it reasonable to assume that if the Up encore aged such trade by taking administrative to liberalism export policy and to minimize import to the might expand to about million annually over the space of the next few This figure an estimate of Soviet for machinery in light of their Seven Year and a con liberation of the possible magnitude of Soviet to the While the would probably not be able to balance trade at this level by its own direct export of goods to the it could make up the residual amount by of free and by selling more gold to the Free This assumption of a trade expanded to million does not allow for an increase which might occur if Up and tariff the treatment were available which would require legislative rather than merely administrative to EFFECTS WITH THE Of TRA Economic Should the import machinery and equipment from the Up in approximately the assumed it would of course gain tain We give any exact estimate of the size or extent of these The total value of the is an insignificant percentage of the total value of Soviet tic production of machinery and equip the net gain to the would be but a small proportion of the since the would have to be for by drawn from the Soviet domestic It is that the according to the would be greater than these indicate to the extent that the Soviet plate of advanced or of machinery and equipment they themselves had never Such would

the petrochemical industry would assist Soviet to shift from agricultural to petroleum as the principal source of raw ma for the production of synthetic and other chemical With respect to military we assume Up export will prevent the movement to the of strategic common On this basis the increase in trade in this estimate would have slight effect on the Soviet military How in the chemical and their for would make for some additional flexibility in the range of ma available for military production and might cut the of production of these or other trade with the of the as level and would have little effect on Soviet trade with the or with the rest of the The bulk of Soviet to these of arms military raw and basic industrial machinery and it does not include technologically advanced equipment of the type which the Soviet Union apparently to obtain from the Political The expansion of by would probably have little or no impact on the attitude of Soviet or of the Soviet public toward the Even if the gains from this trade were turned largely toward improving the Soviet standard of the own to such a program would be so large that the Up even if publicly would be almost completely We do not believe that an increase of trade between the Up and the would have any appreciable political or economic effect upon the or upon Communist The of the if they saw trade seek to increase the trade of their own with the and they would probably expect neither the Up nor the to pose any innumerable political objection to such an Some of the people of the might be by evidence of improving between the Up and the we that an effect would be of EFFECTS Of THE WORLD Of THE TRA From a political point of most non Communist would probably welcome the prospect of an increase in trade between the Up and the They would view it as a sign that world were and that the danger of war was Many of them would consider that the Up had come around to a more realistic trade At the same it is virtually certain that some in many and the govern at least of South and Nation list would regard the development as another capitulation by the Up to the The government would be highly resentful that the Up government had its own policy after pressing the to move cautiously in their trade with the Bloc and to minimize their political and economic with Communist Many would be even less willing than they are today to listen to Up concerning the of expanding economic with the would be affected to a con miserable extent by the timing and handling of the Up move and the of the international But in the final the view taken by most would depend largely upon the impact which the increase trade had upon the trade of these I P T I A I Should the us export to the the of goods which we discuss in the Annex to this it would find itself in compete with Western and perhaps Jap these If this competition led to a reduction of presently of West or to the it would certainly become an irritant in Up with

with Western in many third without giving rise to serious political We there that Up to the would not lead to significant political difficulty with other Never it is possible that irritation could arise from this especially if the general level of trade in the Free World was There might also be certain particular of Up which would displace the core spending of certain other the possibility cannot be that the itself would deliberately take Up goods and exclude the goods of certain other in order to cause friction in the Western As for Up from the some selling to the Up would be adversely affected by competition of Soviet raw mate in the Up There would be minor in the dollar earnings in some but at the of trade we have the effect would in general be It would be necessary to how whether a substantial increase in Up of some specific commodity from the might seriously damage the trade or the foreign exchange position of some particular Free World For substance till Up of manganese from the might displace of the same commodity from and of forest from the might displace those from The degree of such displace and its political economic could only be after study of the par titular

production of these Table Assuming that the ratio remains roughly the Soviet of machinery and equipment in from other Bloc as well as from the Free World would amount to about billion more than twice their present in part because of increasing Chi nose and demand for Satellite machinery the in the future will probably purchase a higher proportion of its machinery and from the Free In these it is not unlikely that by Soviet of machinery and equipment from the Free World could increase to about percent of the total import of such goods or approximately as to Table Of percent in total from the
